They included the termination of my marriage to a once nationally popular folksinger , a fling with a redheaded young woman I 'd initially thought was just a night nurse , the intrusion into my life of spies and secret agents of several nations , and my conversion , at the age of sixty-one , into what I can only describe as some sort of superhero . My knees started talking to me the second day I was back home in my Marin County home after my stay at the Slesinger Foundation Clinic over in San Rafael . I was sitting in our beamceilinged living room , looking down toward San Francisco Bay far below . As usual , there were quite a few bright sailboats wandering around down there . My wife had propped two fet paisley pillows behind my back and draped a Navajo rug over the lower part of me before driving to a rehearsal studio in Sausalito . You 've probably heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and two fellows were the Scattergood Singers , very successful singers of liberal folk tunes who came damn close to winning a Grammy . Mavis had recently rounded up two new fellows and was hoping to revive the Scattergood Singers . Only snag was Edmond Scully , the new banjo player , who felt the group should be called Edmond , Fred and Mavis . My name , by the way , is Frank Whitney , and I 'm a retired advertising agency art director . " Do n't worry about falling down while you 're home alone , dear , " said a motherly voice . Though I had the impression the voice was coming from the vicinity of my left knee , I glanced around the big sunlit room . There was nobody to be seen . " Imagine your wife abandoning you , and you only two days out of surgery . " Leaning forward on our tangerine-colored sofa , I tugged off the red , gold , and yellow blanket so I could scrutinize my knees . " What you really ought to be worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wrinkled denim slacks , " is what your dumpy missus is really doing in Sausalito with Edmond and Fred . Especially Edmond , who 's a real stud but , truth to tell , a lousy banjo picker . " The motherly voice of my other knee said , " Now do n't get poor Frank all riled up . A wayward wife is n't the major problem he has to- " " Pardon me , " I put in , reaching toward the blond coffee table for my cell phone . " I 'd best call the Slesinger to report these hallucinations . " " Relax , dimbulb , " advised my right knee . " You ai n't goofy . What they implanted , unbeknownst to you , chum , are some very state-of-the-art artificial knees . Or rather not they but Dr. Wallace Dowling . " " Dowling ? " I frowned , putting the phone down . " He 's not my physician . " " Were you awake during the operation , pal ? " " Well , no , but- " " Dowling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Dowling is a very nice man , " said my left knee . " We 're starting to get very worried about- " " Button your yap , sister . We 'll get to that in- " " Wait now , " I said , frowning . " They mentioned Dowling on Wake Up , Marin this morning , did n't they ? " It had n't taken me long to get used to my unusual knees . Here I was having a conversation with them already . " That they did , kiddo . The doc vanished last night , did a bunk , vamoosed . " " Come now , the poor man was obviously abducted . " I cleared my throat . " It 's too bad about Dr. Dowling , " I admitted . " However , I 'm much more interested in why my replacement knees can talk . There sure as hell was n't anything about that in the brochure they- " " All in good time , " my motherly knee told me . " First , young man , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for us . " " He ai n't a young man , " corrected my other knee . " Sixty-one puts him in the old fart category . All you got to do is take a gander at his puss to realize- " " How can you look at me ? " I wanted to know . " Knees do n't have the power of vision . " " We 're using your eyes , dopey . When you looked in the bathroom mirror this morning , we took a gander , " explained my knee . " Got a look at your missus , too . Jeez , is she going to seed . Only forty-nine , too . She 's going to be a real blimp by the time she 's your age . " " Now , now , Mavis is still a very attractive woman . And she has a truly lovely voice . " " Oh yeah ? How come this broad has n't had a singing gig in six years ? " I again requested , " Tell me why my new knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a guinea pig , sappo . He wanted to test us out-and we 're a lot more than knees , by the way-before installing his gadgets in somebody important . " I shot to my feet and began to pace the big room . " No , before I call the clinic , I 'm going to get in touch with my attorney . And maybe the AMA . " I went striding over to one of the big view windows to gaze out at the glaring afternoon . " Notice anything , dude ? " " Hum ? " " You walk pretty good for a gink just out of surgery . " I inhaled sharply , stared down at my feet . " Yeah , now that you mention it , how come I- " At that point I began to tap dance . I circled the living room , doing a pretty fair impression of Fred Astaire . Then I completed a brief but complex Irish jig , added a few very convincing Flamenco stomps , and settled down in one of our feux Morris chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hell can I- " " First , " cut in my right knee , " ask not what your knees can do for you , chum , but what you can do for us . " I overcame the impulse to stand up again . I did n't want to risk dancing around the room anymore . " Do for my knees ? " The motherly one said , " All we 'd like you to do is help us find Dr. Dowling . " " I 'm not much of a cook , " I said . " You are now , " my right knee assured me . My knees and I were standing in our large redwood and copper kitchen . Dusk was settling in outside . " You need some good warm food inside you , dear boy , " said my other knee . " A meat loaf sandwich indeed . " " Soyloaf on twelve-grain gluten-free bread , " I corrected . Mavis had called a few minutes earlier to say the New Scattergood Singers ' rehearsal was running late . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd left a substantial sandwich for me in the refrigerator . " Late rehearsal , my fanny , " commented my right knee . " It 's shack-up time in the old corral if- " " You do n't have a fanny , " I pointed out as I found myself trotting out into the kitchen . " Figure of speech . " Now I was standing in front of our state-of-the-art turquoise-colored stove . " These new knees-you guys , that isyou can convert me into a gourmet chef ? What the hell does Dr. Dowling have in mind ? " " His initial assignment from the National Office of Clandestine- " " No need to blab too much , sis . " " Well , the poor man has to know what 's happened to him . " " Okay , but I 'll give him the skinny . Dowling is an expert on advanced robotics and performance-enhancing implants . " " Why would a guy with those qualifications be working at the Slesinger ? " I noticed that I had walked over to the fridge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of portabella mushrooms . " Some parsley , too , " suggested my maternal knee . The other knee continued , " Doc Dowling has a little lab hidden down in the bowels of the joint . He 's developed a device that can convert an average gink like you into a crackerjack fighting man . Once inserted it can- " " Why does a crackerjack fighting man need to tap dance or concoct omelets ? " I was beating an assortment of omelet ingredients in one of our earth-color mixing bowls . The maternal knee explained , " Dr. Dowling , bless him , believes that even a brutal fighting man should be well-rounded . You 'll find that now that his secret serum is coursing through your veins you- " " Secret serum . " I stopped whisking , and goosebumps visited both my arms . " You will be a wiz at math , including advanced calculus , speak six additional languages , including Mandarin Chinese and- " " You wo n't have any further trouble getting it up , " added my other knee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hey , I do n't have any problems with that . " " Have n't had much opportunity to test that premise of late , have you , dude ? " " Well , no , but- " " Let 's get on with fixing dinner . A nice salad will fit in perfectly with our omelet . " As I gathered the ingredients for a small salad out of the crispers , I asked , " Why did Dowling put his gadget in artificial knees ? " " He only did that in your case . Usually , chum , the enhancer , housed in two very compact units , will be installed in one of the buttocks . " " And why test it on me ? " " Dowling wanted to run a few human tests right now , but the higher ups nixed that . They did n't think the enhancer was quite ready yet . So the doc decided to try it out on his own . " " But why me ? I 'm too old to be a fighting man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old wreck like you into a first-rate warrior , then the enhancer will work on anybody . That means that a lot of young wrecks can be turned into gung-ho soldiers come the next big one . " I was crumbling feta cheese into my salad dressing . " How come the doctor did n't ask my permission ? And was he planning to let me know eventually about his illegal experiment ? " " Of course he was , dear boy . Unfortunately , he vanished . " " Bright and early maAana , kiddo , we 'll start hunting for him . You ca n't trust the FBI to track him down , nor the ... Oops ! " I set down the bottle of olive oil I 'd picked up . " What ? " " Visitors . Let me handle this , jocko . " " How can a knee- " The door chimes sounded . Two tall men in dark suits were standing on our twilight doorstep . Both had close-cropped blond hair and were in their early thirties . The leaner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitney ? " " Yeah , and who might- " " I 'm Agent Mickens with the National Counterspy Bureau . " He showed me a plastic ID card with a holographic portrait of him included . As he tilted it toward me his image took on a third dimension . " And this is Agent Tubridy , also with the NCB . " When Tubridy , the bulkier one , tilted his ID , the portrait remained two-dimensional . I was about to suggest they come into the living room , when I found myself saying , " Nice try , buster , but no cheroot . That ID of yours is as phony as a three-buck bill . It lacks the spread eagle and the Colonial flag images that are supposed to appear behind your portrait . " " Sir , I assure you that- " " Looks to me , buddy boy , " I informed him , " like you 're actually in the employ of some second-rate , low-budget Middle European nation with delusions of grandeur . " " In that case , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruno . " The faux Tubridy leaped across our threshold , grabbing me in a very impressive bear hug . To my surprise , I kneed the big man in the groin , which caused him to let go . I then grabbed his arm , applied some sort of martial arts grip , and tossed him halfway across the room . Bruno landed , hard , on Mavis ' Early American rocking chair . The whole damn chair , which I 've never much liked , collapsed under him . Discouraged , he got to his feet to go running across the living room . He slid open the wide glass door to the deck and dived outside into the approaching night . Following , I tackled the big fake agent . He fell with a substantial thunk , twisted free , and grabbed up Mavis 's large potted cactus . I avoided his attempt to conk me with the heavy orange pot , jabbed him in the midsection . He yowled , toppled back against the deck railing . Along with the potted cactus , he went falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The pot shattered , sending orange shards into the new night , and the cactus shot up a few feet and then bounced on Bruno 's crewcut head . He got , shakily , to his feet to go running , shakily , away into the night . I spun around , ready to face the fake agent Mickens . My front door stood open , the living room was empty . " Damn it all , " commented my right knee , " you let both of those bozos get clean away . " " Now , now . He did pretty well , considering he 's just getting used to being a crackerjack fighting man . " " Yeah , I suppose so , sis . And , hell , they 'll be more spies and secret agents dropping in from now on . Sure , we can question them . " " More ? " I asked . It was around about midnight that I found out about another batch of my new abilities . Since coming home from the clinic I 'd been sleeping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was driving me home from the Slesinger , that my new knees made funny squeaking noises that might keep her awake , especially if I tossed and turned as I usually did at night . " That 's disturbing enough , " she pointed out , " without adding metallic sound effects . " At about ten o'clock that fateful night Mavis was fluffing the pillows on the narrow bed I was temporarily occupying . " You 've got to use that cane I bought you , Frank , " she said as she bent to kiss me on the cheek . " We ca n't have any more accidents like this afternoon . You could have been seriously hurt . Not to mention that the chair cost $500 . " I had n't yet told my wife about my new knees or the visit from the spurious American intelligence agents . I had said I stumbled and fell over the rocker . " Wo n't happen again , dear . " " And do be more careful when you go hobbling out onto the deck , " she continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it only cost $129 , but if you had fallen " I know , I 'm worth at least three times that . " " Seriously , Frank . " Mavis pointed at the cocoa mug on my temporary nightstand . " Drink the hot chocolate I fixed for you . It will help you sleep . " I did n't believe that after my stimulating last few hours I 'd be able to do much in the way of sleeping . But I picked the cup up , took a sip . Then I grimaced . " Not especially sweet . " " We 're watching our intake of sugar , remember . Now drink up . " I drank up and set the mug back on the table . Surprisingly , I was feeling drowsy already . As my wife tiptoed out of the room and quietly shut the door of the bedroom , I sank back and commenced slumbering . " Rise and shine , chum . Off your ox and grab your sox . " I jerked up into a sitting position . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ? " " I 'm okay . Did you wake me up just to- " " Shake a leg , " suggested my right knee . " The game 's afoot . " " What game ? " I swung out of bed , feeling completely awake . " Funny , I do n't feel at all sleepy , but before- " " That 's because we 've counteracted the sleeping potion your fat folknik wife slipped into your hot toddy , dumbo . " " She 's a bit plump , but not- " " Fat or skinny , dude , what you ought to wonder about is why she doped you . " " If she actually did . " I was pulling on a pair of dark blue jeans . My left knee asked , " Who can you trust if you ca n't trust your own knees , dear boy ? " " Socks and shoes and hurry up , " said my other knee . " She 's already pulling out of the driveway . " I continued dressing . " Who ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distaff Pete seeger . " I glanced over at the alarm clock on the nightstand . " Were would Mavis be going at midnight ? " To meet one third of the Scattergood Singers . " Fully clothed , I now had a desire to leave the spare bedroom . " I thought you were interested in locating the missing Dr. Dowling . What 's Edmond Scully-I assume it 's him you 're alluding to-got to do with that ? " " All in good time , " said my maternal knee . " Now put on a warm coat , the night 's turned a bit chilly . " I took my fleece-lined car coat out of the hall closet . " Hey , how am I going to follow Mavis ? We only have one car , the Toyota , and she took that , according to you . " " On foot , dopey . " " Then let 's hope she 's not going far . " " Sausalito . " " Sausalito ? Christ , that 's at least fifteen miles from here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Told you he was still dense , in spite of all the improvements we 've made . " " Not dense , just a mite slow on the uptake . " " What are you implying ? That I 've turned into some sort of Six Million Dollar Man ? " " Was n't that obvious after this afternoon , buddy ? " " I suppose so , but- " " Less gab , more action . " I stepped out into the night . " Slow down a little , dude , " cautioned my right knee , " or you 'll overtake her . " " Do n't be so critical , " said my other knee . " After all , this is his maiden run . " I slowed my pace . " This is neat . I 've been running for over fifteen minutes and I 'm not even winded . And I 'm covering a mile or so every minute . That 's beating every record . " " Quit bragging , Speedy . Concentrate on our mission . " Mavis was taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following our red Toyota , I 'd been running , with ease , along quirky back roads and along narrow , tree-lined lanes . My eyesight had greatly improved , too . I could see the rear lights and our license plates from a quarter mile behind . People do jog by night in Marin County and I slowed to a normal pace when an infrequent car approached , so I did n't attract undue attention . Although one Volvo driver yelled , " Carry a flashlight , asshole ! " as he passed me going in the other direction . A belligerent German Shepherd chased me for a couple minutes , but I easily outran him . " Destination coming up , " announced my right knee . We had reached the outskirts of Sausalito , up in the hills above the bay . Downhill Mavis was signaling for a right turn . Taillight blinking , she eased off the road into the small parking lot next to a small dub called The Lethal Injection . I shifted down to a slow trot , then stopped behind a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd you know Mavis was heading here ? " I asked in a whisper . " Eavesdropping while you were snoozing , chum . " " How could you do- " " Your hearing is enhanced , dear boy . " " We can hunker down here and listen in our your spouse 's midnight rendezvous inside . " " I do n't hear anything but crickets . " " You have to concentrate . We 'll help you get going and show you how to zero in on her and the lad who 's cuckolding you . " " Even if that 's true , which I doubt , what in the hell does it have to do with Dr. Dowling and- " " Listen , dude . " " ... first garage band to fuse hip-hop , bebop , and retro rockabilly , " I heard an MC saying . " Here are the Defrocked Priests for their final set at Lethal Injection . " " Yow , " I remarked as very loud electric music came flooding into my head . " It 'll take another minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " . . . hip hop shabam always reminds me of you , " sang someone through his nose . " . . . but how did they know we were sleeping together , Edmond ? " " They 're spies , flowerbabe , " said Edmond . " They know how to find out stuff . " " This gink calls your wife flowerbabe ? " " So it seems . " " A rather catchy sobriquet . " " Hush , sis , so we can monitor this gabfest . " " You were the one who first intruded . " " Button your yap. " " . . . ca n't believe anyone would think Frank is important , " Mavis was saying to her banjo player . " They 'll pay us $20,000 to lure your useless husband to their lab . " " That would certainly help finance the comeback of the Scattergood Singers , but- " " Edmond , Fred and Mavis , " Edmond corrected . " Still , " continued my wife , " I do n't understand how they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not much of a hubby , but it will bother me if he 's going to bleed all over the place . " " Look , Mavis , they 've got this Dr. Dowling stored away in their clandestine laboratory , " he pointed out . " The guy ought to be able to perform a simple goddamn knee operation . " " But then Frank wo n't have any knees . " " Do n't be obtuse , hon. They 'll obviously force him to replace the knees with new ones . " His voice was sounding a bit impatient . " These spies sounded pretty humane to me . " " You have n't mentioned what country they represent . " " The United Kingdom , I think . " " Are n't you sure ? " " Well , the three of them are very polite and well behaved . They wear tweedy clothes and have BBC accents , " Edmond explained . " I 'd say they 're Brits , though they have n't openly declared that . " " Britain is an ally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like selling Frank 's knees to , say , oh , China or Cuba . " " Course not . And we can sure use $20,000 . " " Be nice if the price were a bit- " " I 'm meeting one of them tomorrow afternoon to set up the details of delivering Frank . I can suggest $25,000 would suit us better . " " Ask for $30,000 . After all he 's my husband . " Mavis ' voice faded out . The Defrocked Priests came back . " Enough , 7 I said and all sound from within the club ceased . I heard crickets again , then a young woman being sick in the parking lot . The note was affixed to the surface of the fridge with a Bob Dylan magnet . Must make unexpected trip to San Fran . To see publicist , dear Since you 're still incapable of driving , you wo n't mind my taking car . Frozen waffles in freezer . Do n't use too much maple syrup because we 're watching our sweets intake . Love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee . " She took off for a roll in the hay with the banjo virtuoso . " " Frozen waffles indeed , " said my other knee . " Let 's whip up a batch of flapjacks . " " I 'm not especially hungry . " " It 's wisest , dear boy , to begin the day with a hearty breakfast . " " Okay , okay . " I fetched a carton of buttermilk out of the refrigerator . The Brazilian secret agents , two of them , arrived as I was setting my plate of syrup-drenched pancakes out on the deck table . They 'd apparently tossed grappling hooks up from below and come climbing up thick plastic ropes . " Bom dia , senhor , " said the first one , " we 're here to inquire after your joelhos . " " Your knees , " translated the second one . " Oh , I 'm doing just fine , better , actually , than I expected . " I remained on my feet , smiling blandly . " Certainly nice of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about- " " Roll up your pants above the knee , " ordered my right knee . I obliged , far from certain why I was . " What 's this tolo up to ? " the other intruder asked of his partner . " Now , dear boy , aim your left knee at the nearest Brazilian . We 'll do the rest . " " I see our cover story about being nothing more than concerned neighbors is n't going to work , senhor , " said the farthest agent as he reached inside his blue blazer . Before I could lift my foot high enough above the redwood deck to aim at my target , the pant leg unrolled and covered the knee again . " Nitwit , " remarked my other knee . " The dang ultrasonic beam wo n't work if the knee is covered . " How the hell am I supposed to know that ? " I reached down to tug up the trouser leg again . " If you would be a shade more confiding , then we- " " Senhor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver at me , " we would very much like you to accompany us to our laboratory , se faz favor , so that we can extract your knees and return to Rio with- " " Aim your damn knee , dude . " The second South American agent had produced a .45 automatic . He , too , was pointing his gun at me . " We would prefer to perform that operation there , but we are prepared to do the job , albeit in a cruder fashion , right here . " " Drop your weapons , " suggested someone up on my slanting red tile roof . I looked up to see a slim , red-haired woman of about thirty-five , clad in a crisp nurse 's uniform , standing there with a .38 revolver in each hand . " Nurse Munson , " I said loudly , " what are you doing on my roof ? " Ginger Munson had been my night nurse during my recent stay at the Siesinger Clinic . Just then , as one of the Brazilians was aiming his gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin line of blurred air shot out at the nearest agent . It struck him in the middle of his chest , then vanished . " Inferno ! " He remarked as he fell over onto the deck , bumping against the table and upsetting my plate of syrupy pancakes . While this was occurring , Ginger had jumped down off the roof to tackle the other Brazilian intruder . He was now lying face down , unconscious , and she was handcuffing his hands behind his back . " These fellows are from Brazil 's Agnda Muito Secreta , " she said as she stood clear of the sprawled man . " This one is Antonio Bulcao . " " Apparently you 're more than a night nurse . " " I 'm with the National Counterspy Bureau . I 've been working undercover at- " " The last person who claimed to be with the NCB , " I cut in as I gathered up the fallen flapjacks , " turned out to be a phony and so- " " Nix , " warned my right knee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a darn favorable impression on me at the clinic , Mr. Whitney , " said the government agent . " So I 'm assuming you 'll cooperate and return to the clinic and , you know , voluntarily return those knees so that- " " Whoa , honey , " said my knee . " How come it took you so dang long to get here ? If we had n't been on duty , a stewpot of spies and secret agents might 've hauled this poor sap off to- " " Now , now , " said my other knee , " I 'm sure this sweet young lady has a perfectly acceptable explanation . And there 's no reason to refer to poor Frank as a sap , now that he 's been converted into a- " " I was reassigned to collect Mr. Whitney after , well , my partner and I did n't succeed in locating Dr. Dowling . " " Was your partner working undercover at the Slesinger , too ? " I asked her . " Yes , she 's Hazel LaMond , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me backrubs . " " We really must be going , " Ginger told me . " I do hope you 'll come along without too much fuss . " I said , " Suppose you found Dowling and brought him back , Nurse Munson ? Do they give bonuses in the NCB ? " She took a step back from me , staring into my face and frowning . " Do you have some idea where he might be ? " " Sister , " said my knee , " if you tag along with us , we 'll lead you right to him . How about it ? " Midway across the Golden Gate Bridge fog closed in around Ginger 's SUV . " Going to make it harder to follow them , " I remarked . Ginger , wearing dark jeans and a black pullover , was driving . " We know where they 're going . " " Use your noggin , " added my right knee . " We have the ability to track your cheatin ' wife and her banjo beau because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy has n't quite gotten used to being superhuman , " my other knee reminded . " I would n't call myself superhuman . " " Do n't be so modest , dear boy . " Ginger asked , " Do they always go on like this ? " " Pretty much . " " Hush until we get across the bridge , " the redheaded NCB agent suggested . It was just about three thirty in the afternoon when we reached fogbound San Francisco . Earlier we 'd staked out Edmond 's cottage in Sausalito . Using my recently acquired eavesdropping abilities , I overheard the phone call from one of the UK agents . He 'd invited Edmond to rendezvous with him at their hideaway across the bay in San Francisco to go over plans for luring me into their clutches . Since my wife was with the banjo player and not consulting with her publicist , she was allowed to tag along . The British agents were operating out of a two-story Victorian house in Presidio Heights . As Ginger drove by the Britishers ' lair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lemon-yellow house . We parked the SUV just around the corner on Laurel Street . " Let 's tune in on the Brits , " said my right knee . Ginger said , " I brought my own surveillance equipment , a sound gun and- " " I 'll broadcast through my knee , " I found myself saying . " We can both hear . " " Cease babbling , " suggested my knee . " . . . sorry , old man , but $25,000 is absolutely the most we can offer . These are tough times in the UK and hence we- " " But Mavis is betraying her husband , " Edmond pointed out . " That ought to be worth at least $30,000 . " " Look here , old chap , " a second British voice said , " we can simply go over to the lady 's house , cosh the bloke on the head , and drag him over here to our hidden lab . " However , we have a reputation for subtlety and we also rather enjoy luring someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . " Mavis said , " All right , okay . We 'll take the $25,000 . I do n't want to have poor Frank suffer any more physical injury than is absolutely necessary . " Sighing , Ginger gave my arm a sympathetic pat . A British agent , the one with the more nasal voice , said , " What say we now discuss ways and means to get this Whitney cove to trot into our trap of his own free will ? " " Well , flowerbabe and I have been thinking that maybe- " " I say , who in blazes is- " The broadcast abruptly ceased . I inquired , " Why 'd you- " " Out your window , dude . " I turned to see a slim young fellow in a blue blazer leaning toward my window , a snub nose .32 in his hand . I opened the window . " Something ? " " By Jove , this is a blooming bit of luck , " he said , pointing the gun directly at my head . " Rather ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been eavesdropping on us , I 've been concealed in yonder shrubs using my sound gun to- " " I 'm with the NCB , " Ginger told him . " I 'd advise you to put down your weapon and lead us to Dr. Dowling . " " Hard cheese , " replied the agent . " What 's actually going to happen , madam , is that you 're going to turn this Whitney chap over to- " " Look into my eyes , " I found myself telling him . " Really , old man , this is hardly the time or place for a flirtation . " " Look deeply into my eyes , " I suggested . " You are growing drowsy . Soon , quite soon , you 'll be nodding off . " " I say , I do feel a mite sleepy now that you mention it . " His eyelids were fluttering , his gun hand dropped to his side . " I did n't know I could hypnotize people , " I said . My right knee addressed the hypnotized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do , dude . " " Whatever you say , sir . " " I say , Denis , " said the plump , sandy-haired British agent who opened the door of the yellow Victorian , " this is a bit of all right . You 've brought in Frank Whitney on your own and now we sha n't have to pay his wife and her paramour a blooming cent . " He stepped back , allowing his colleague to herd us into the corridor . " **35;57;TOOLONG . " " You 're sounding even more stilted and affected than usual , " noticed Nigel . " And why , now that I notice , does he have his trousers rolled up above his knees ? " After kicking the door shut with a backward kick of my foot , I aimed a bare knee at the inquisitive British agent . " This seems hardly cricket , " he remaiked as the sonic beam hit him in the midsection , Ginger caught him before he dropped , out cold , to the Persian-carpeted hallway floor . " Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hypnotized agent , " escort us to Dr. Dowling . " " **25;94;TOOLONG . " As we followed him down into the cellar lab , Ginger said to me , " I 'm going to recommend that they treat you genUy , Frank . But , gosh , soon as the doctor is ready to operate , he 's probably going to replace your new knees with less complex ones . " " We 'll just see about that , " said my right knee . " This dude ought to get a frigging medal . " Well , Dr. Dowling decided against surgery . What he did was deactivate my knees electronically from without , converting them into just plain artificial knees . He had several other enhancers in the works . The National Counterspy Bureau decided not to brainwash me so that I 'd forget about Dowling 's invention . That was because Ginger Munson persuaded her chief that I was trustworthy . Also I had to sign several binding agreements that I would never say anything . Mavis , only moderately chagrined at having her affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a foreign power , decided to move out of our marriage and take up residence with her banjo player . The fling with Ginger that I alluded to earlier did n't commence until about a week after we 'd rescued Dowling . I was living alone in the house by then , me and my perfectly plain and average knees . I 'd gotten interested in cooking during the short time I 'd been enhanced , and on that particular early evening I was in the kitchen , cookbook spread out on a counter . I was trying to create a mushroom pizza from scratch . The cell phone resting on the counter rang . I wiped a splotch of tomato sauce off my hand and answered . " Hello ? " " How are you , Frank ? " inquired Ginger . " Do you miss your former knees or powers ? " " Not too much , no . " That was only partly true . I did n't miss the heckling , but some of the added abilities I would n't mind having still . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not posing as a nurse tonight , and I do n't have any other NCB chores , " she said . " Might I drop by if you 're free ? Possibly we could go out to dinner . I might be able to put it on my expense account . " " Hey , we do n't have to go out , " I told her . " I 'm making a pizza . " " I 'll stop and get ingredients for a salad . " " I 'm making the salad , too . " " Well , then I 'll just bring wine . Or are you making that , too ? " " Nope . About eight ? " " Fine . " The call ended and setting the phone down , I returned to my cooking . I still had to roll out the dough . " Hey , dopey , let me help out . If you screw up you ai n't going to impress your tootsie . " I dropped the small rolling pin . It hit the floor , rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've been deactivated , " I told my right knee . " The old biddy who was your left knee is long gone , pal , " said the knee . " But , c'm on , you did n't think Dowling could knock off someone as clever and crafty as me , did you ? " " What exactly are you up to ? " " We make , I have to admit , a pretty good team . " " Oh , so ? " " Let 's cook up the pizza , " said my returned knee . " Then you can impress the broad , maybe fool around a little . Later , dude , we can talk business . " 
@@4021935 Much of history , either biological or cultural , is an arms race . And as knowledge and abilities grow subtler and more sophisticated , so do weapons and defenses. . . . // When he regained consciousness , Surgeon-at-Arms Roald Vik of the 3rd Armored Biomedical Brigade , Affiliated Planets Unified Defense Force , was only moderately worried by his initial view of the room . Unadorned pale-blue ceiling and walls . Institutional , glossy-surfaced armchair . On the wall opposite his bed , a curtain that he assumed covered an observation window . So : a typical jail cell . But then he noticed the faint stinging scent , like rubbing alcohol-and his bed 's railing bore an impressive control panel . Frowning , he sat up and looked over his shoulder . Though he did n't recognize the particular connectors on the wall behind him , in his brief career he 'd seen enough monitor and life-support fittings to recognize the overall configuration . But what sort of hospital bed lacked restraining straps ? Vik 's apprehension increased further when he discovered an excruciatingly tender , fist-sized swelling above his right ear . Had he crash-landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's voice from somewhere near the curtained window . Vik could n't see a loudspeaker . But though he still had no idea why he was in a hospital , now the knowledge of his location and mission flooded back to him-for the woman had spoken in Flemish . A bit over two centuries ago , an Affiliated Planets automated probe had discovered the world of Nieuw Viaanderen orbiting a star about fifteen light-years from Vik 's homeworld , Eiriksson . Like all human colonies , Nieuw Viaanderen was still recovering from the Collapse ; like most in this region , its recovery had lagged Eiriksson 's by several generations . By the time of its discovery the planet 's leading civilization had regained a technology level averaging late-eighteenth-century Europe-well behind that period in physics and engineering , though significantly ahead in chemistry and biology . As usual in such cases , after the probe 's initial reports had been received and reviewed , a message was sent instructing the probe to release a stealth depopulating agent into the planet 's biosphere . The A.P . in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no truly civilized society , surely , would prefer the untidiness and sufferings of war . But in the century following the agent 's release , the probe failed to detect any drop in the local birth-rate . This unprecedented development , so potentially threatening to the A.P . ' s longstanding strategy for expansion and regional domination , demanded urgent on-site investigation . And so sub-lieutenant Roald Vik , recently commissioned UDF Surgeon-at-Anns , was crammed into a coldsleep pod and fired off on a seventy-year voyage to Nieuw Viaanderen . He could remember waking in orbit , seven decades of hypno-lessons in the probe 's observations-plus copious Earth history of possible relevance , including four dialects of Flemish-still echoing in his head . He remembered reviewing update summaries from the old but still-functioning probe , which in the two hundred years since its original report had identified a number of anomalies that did n't match any previously recorded patterns of post-industrial cultural or technological development . He 'd chosen his first site to investigate . There 'd been no crash-landing-he recalled his on-target arrival during an overcast night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship was well camouflaged , he 'd walked out of the forest to the nearby village . He could even remember the sickly-looking fern-like plant sitting on the bar beside him as he sipped a beer and struck up a conversation with the bartender . But then- ? Vik touched the swelling above his ear . Had he fallen ? Been attacked ? " Would you mind , " asked the woman 's voice , " if I opened this curtain ? " " Alstublieft , " he replied . Please . He tried to mimic her accent . Motorized , the curtain slid open to reveal a large pane of glass . In the dimly lit room beyond stood a pale , dark-haired , middle-aged woman in a pastel blouse and white coat . She leaned toward the glass . " How are you feeling , Mr. Boeykens ? " So she 'd seen the identification papers he 'd been carrying . He wondered what she made of their vagueness . " My head , how- ? " " You do n't recall ? Ah , well that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you fell . According to our investigator , you tripped over the leg of a chair as you followed him out of the tavern . " Vik frowned . " Investigator ? " Her eyebrows lifted . " From the provincial Department of Health . Exactly what do you remember ? " " I was drinking withier ... a man sat beside me . . . " He struggled unsuccessfully for a clearer image , then shook his head in frustration . " Please , do n't worry . A bit of amnesia is quite common with head injuries . " Yes , of course , he thought-but how frustrating ! What if he had discovered the newcomer 's association with the health department , and managed to steer the discussion to an aborted infertility epidemic of nearly two centuries ago ? Maybe this " investigator " had already given him the answers that the A.P . required ! " In any case , " the woman continued , " what we really need to learn are some facts about you . Your papers are quite incomplete-we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting our province , who may have come into contact with you ... " Vik refocused his attention . He 'd taken her for a local physician , but now he wondered . Slowly , he said , " I 'm sorry , but I do n't understand . . . why all of these questions ? And why are you standing in another room ? I do n't even know your name . " She pursed her lips . " My apologies . I am Dr. Steibs , head of Infectious Diseases for the Department of Health . And you , Mr. Boeykens , are quite the mystery . " " I 'm sorry , but- " " You are in an isolation room . U that bartender had n't been so observant , I shudder to think how many more people you might have exposed . It 's urgent that we trace your movements since your arrival . " " Exposed ? " Alarmed , Vik pulled up the sleeves of his loose pajamas in search of rashes . He felt at his face , tried to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Boeykens , calm yourself ! We 've already started you on the appropriate antibiotic . You 'll be over the infection in a few days . " Some local bug , then-he must have picked it up in the forest . " What sort of infection ? " " Besnoitia speecki . " She spoke the name with careful enunciation and then leaned away , as if she had just delivered news of great portent and now awaited his reaction . Besnoitia . The genus did n't sound completely unfamiliar . He rummaged through his memories of General Microbiology . . . . Some son of protozoan parasite ? Not one that caused any human diseases , though , he was reasonably sure . And certainly not an organism that the UDF had ever weaponized . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " But I 'm not familiar with that- " He caught himself before using any terms that might reveal his medical training , " -that germ . ' ' His statement apparently surprised her . " Surely you must have taken some classes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Boeykens ? " He was afraid to reply-having planned for a casual evening in a pub rather than an inquisition , Vik had prepared only the sketchiest of cover stories . Now he wished that basic spycraft had been part of the standard medical curriculum . But , he realized , Dr. Steibs had already provided him with a perfect evasion . " Why , I grew up in- " Drawing on his training in interrogating patients , Vik did his best to mime Sudden Unexpected Uncertainty . " In- " He moved on to Mounting Confusion , followed by Increasing Concern . " I can't- " And now : Apprehension . . . and then , Alarm ! " I ca n't remember ! " Dr. Steibs frowned . " Please , Mr. Boeykens , this is very important . Try to focus on just the past few days . Can you recall entering our province ? Our town ? " He shook his head in what he hoped looked like Fearful Misery . " No . I do n't remember a thing . I was sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all a blank ! " " I see . " She crossed her arms before her chest and clucked her tongue a few times , looking thoughtful . Vik , whose grades in neurology had not been among his highest , began to wonder whether he 'd picked such a clever stratagem , after all . Outside of adventure stories , how common was global amnesia ? But finally Dr. Steibs said , " All right , please try to remain calm . I expect that your memory will return over the next day or two . Do n't push too hard ; just let it come on its own . " In the meantime , ' ' she continued , " I 've got a different sort of question for you . One moment . . . " Relieved that she 'd accepted his performance , Vik watched as Dr. Steibs pulled a stylus of some sort from her pocket , and turned to the side . She leaned over as if writing or drawing on a table . He could see her make a large circular movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something aside and drew a series of straight lines and curves . Dr. Steibs straightened up and briefly examined her work . Then she lifted a white page and pressed it against the window ; it remained affixed when she removed her hand . She smoothed a second sheet onto the glass beside the first . She looked over the pages at Vik . " Tell me what you see . " The first sheet bore a large circle containing three irregular shapes . At a glance he recognized the three distinctive continents of Nieuw Viaanderen . " A map of the world , " he said , wondering what she was after . She nodded . " Very good . And what else ? " He turned his attention toward the second page stuck to the glass . But then he remembered his still-unexplained infection . " This Besnoitia- " he forced himself to stumble over the syllables- " you have n't told me its symptoms . Is there anything I should be watching out for ? " She shook her head . But Vik thought that she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each meal , and everything will be fine . " " But the symptoms- " " I wo n't be able to explain those to you for a couple of days . " Before he could respond , she added , " I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow , Mr. Boeykens . " She touched the wall beside the window , and the curtain glided shut . Meals arrived through a slot below the window . On that evening 's dinner tray , and again at breakfast , was a small paper cup holding a pair of pink pills , each embossed with a tiny " KM . " Vik swallowed the dinner pills . But at breakfast he set the cup aside when he returned his tray to the slot . As soon as Dr. Steibs opened the curtain , maybe an hour later , he held up one of the pills . " What are you giving me ? " She pursed her lips . " You really do need to take your medication on time , Mr. Boeykens . " " Just tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ koningmycin . A very old , very reliable antibiotic . Though if you do n't know about Besnoitia , then I do n't suppose koningmycin is familiar , either . " He studied the pink pill , no wiser than before . " Please , " she said . He looked up to see her pointing at the paper cup . He shrugged , and then fetched a glass of water from the lavatory . He swallowed the pills . Dr. Steibs gave him the smallest of smiles . " So-how is your memory this morning ? Anything coming back yet ? " She did n't seem particularly perturbed when he shook his head . " Well , " she said , " then we 'll just have to accept another day of mystery . " Vik wondered at her newfound lack of urgency . " Otherwise , I trust you 're feeling well ? No headaches , dizziness ? Blurry vision ? Good . Could you take another look at my artwork here , and tell me what you see ? " Baffled , he approached the window to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Nieuw Vlaanderen , " he reported . The second sheet held some uninteresting cross-hatching . He looked back at the map , then to her . " I told you that yesterday . What is the point of this ? Some sort of psychological test ? Or are you just curious about my knowledge of geography ? " " I think , " she said , " that 111 be able to answer your questions tomorrow . In the meantime , try to dredge up any memories you might happen to have regarding lancet flukes . Or Taxoplasma . " The curtain dosed before he could respond . When the curtain reopened the next morning , Vik again had something to show Dr. Steibs . Holding up an empty juice glass from his breakfast tray , he demanded , " Are all of your isolation rooms infested ? " Dr. Steibs peered at the tumbler as he brought it to the window . He thought he saw her lips quirk into a fleeting smile . " Where did you find that ? " she asked . " On my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motionless at the glass 's bottom . " Look how swollen its abdomen is-it was sucking my blood ! Probably infected me with some horrible new germs . " " No , " she said . " I do n't think it has . " She bent down to squint into the glass . " Dermanyssus speeckt . " Her voice had softened , as if she were fascinated at the sight . He glanced at the bug . Maybe half a centimeter across , its many legs and antennae crisscrossed each other to form a peculiar , asymmetric pattern . He 'd been trying to puzzle out that pattern for the past hour , but could n't seem to keep himself focused on the task . " Say , " he asked , " your koningmycin does n't have any cognitive side-effects , does it ? I 've been having trouble with my concentration . " Dr. Steibs looked up to meet his gaze , but before she could answer he recalled her apparent familiarity with the bloodsucker in his juice glass . " So , this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . " This time she did n't try to hide her smile . " Nobody 's seen one in two hundred years . " He gaped at her in confusion . Then she held up a finger , and swung it downward to point at her two drawings . Where yesterday he 'd seen only a dull jumble of lines and curves , today he saw a peculiar , asymmetric pattern . Very slowly , he rotated his juice glass until the bug matched Dr. Steibs 's sketch . Vik stepped back from the window until he bumped against the armchair . He let himself fell into it , still holding the tumbler and its cryptic occupant . " This , " he said , " would be a good time for explanations . " Apparently she had a chair on her side of the window , too ; when she sat , Vik could see only her head and shoulders . " Are you familiar , ' ' she began , " with the lancet fluke ? " At his blank expression , she continued . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the library data crystals we discovered ten years ago . The fluke larvae take over the nervous system of their carrier , a particular species of ant . Every evening they force the ant to leave its colony and climb to the top of a blade of grass ; it hangs on until dawn , then returns home and leads a normal day . This cycle continues until eventually a cow happens along and eats the blade of grass , thus delivering the fluke to its definitive host . " Vik had had instructors like this-you asked them a straightforward question and they responded with what seemed like a complete non sequitur . When you fell into their trap by pointing out their failure to answer your question , they pounced with their prepared rant on the inadequacy of students these days . Only then did they finally provide the missing information that connected their initial response to your original question . Vik had learned to deal with such teachers by looking attentive and waiting . He did that now . After a few seconds , Dr. Steibs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , mice and rats become extremely anxious and fearful when they smell a cat . But infect them with Toxoplasma and not only do they lose their fear , they actually find themselves attracted to cat odors . Rather inconvenient for the rodents , as you might imagine-but Toxoplasma can only reproduce within the gut of its definitive host , a cat . " Vik looked nervously at his juice glass . " So this insect- " " It 's a mite , actually . " " -this mite , it 's the carrier for the Besnoitia parasite that infected me ? And the Besnoitia makes the mite want to suck human blood ? " Dr. Steibs looked quite disappointed in him . " No , Mr. Boeykens . The mite is the parasite 's definitive host . You are the carrier . " The tumbler slipped from his fingers . Vik watched anxiously as it rolled across his lap and fell to the floor . He leapt to his feet . The unbroken glass was rolling toward the dark space beneath the bed ; just in time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Vik lifted the glass for another look at its occupant . The tumbler was empty . Vik jumped backwards , banging an elbow on the wall . Then , frantic , he scanned the floor all around the chair . After several long seconds he finally saw the mite , near where the glass had initially landed . On its numerous legs it was advancing , very slowly , toward Vik 's bare foot . He slammed the inverted juice glass to the floor , trapping the bug inside . Then , with great care , he slid the glass and its prisoner toward the middle of the room . Keeping his eye on the glass , he stepped backwards until he could once more lower himself into the armchair . As Vik began to catch his breath , Dr. Steibs raised an eyebrow . " Shall I continue ? " " Alstublieft , " mumbled Vik . " These mites , we assume , are ubiquitous wherever humans live . Although of course we ca n't prove it from only Nieuw Viaanderen observations , the degree of specialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been living with our species for thousands of years . Perhaps since before the earliest civilizations . " " But- " She held up her hand to head off any interruption . " The mite acquires Besnoitia from an infected human 's bloodstream . The parasite reproduces in the mite 's salivary glands ; its larvae then escape into another human when the mite next feeds . From there the larvae travel to their carrier 's brain , where as they mature they exert an exceedingly subtle cognitive effect . " Vik had regained enough composure to want to reassert his own cognitive abilities . " The human , " he hazarded , " loses the ability to see that pattern . " He pointed toward Dr. Steibs 's drawing . " Nearly correct . " She tilted her head , apparently not completely unimpressed with him . " Infected humans can still see the mite ; electrophysiological studies have confirmed this . But the sight becomes remarkably uninteresting . One glance dispels all awareness of the mite-including not only its image but also the tickle of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovers one of die mites immediately forgets that discovery . " Koningmycin , " she continued , " was chanced upon quite accidentally . But once people could see the mite , it did n't take long to also uncover the parasite and work out the details . We thought we had long ago eradicated both organisms worldwide-until you came along , Mr. Boeykens . " Not wanting her to pursue that line of thought , but also genuinely curious , Vik asked , " Getting rid of the Besnoitia , what health effects has that had ? Besides allowing people to notice the mite . " Again her head tilted . " A very perceptive question . Indeed , there have been three beneficial effects . Five percent of schizophrenia cases had lacked a known cause-now it 's known , and eliminated . The same for half of all previously unexplained epilepsy . " " Impressive . " " But it 's the final effect that has had the greatest impact . What would you say is the defining aspect of life ? " The question took Vik off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction by non sequitur-how he answered the apparently irrelevant question would n't actually matter . So he offered the first response that occurred to him . " Reproduction ? " She dismissed his reply with a wave of her hand . " No , Mr. Boeykens . Pattern matching . " Vik was intrigued ; none of his instructors had ever suggested such a connection . " Consider : a rabbit detects a certain canine aroma , or hears a distinctive padded footfall ; immediately it recognizes a pattern of danger , and flees . Just as the same rabbit will dig up the root of a plant whose leaves it has learned to associate with food . And that plant , too , is a pattern-matcher , responding to lengthening periods of daylight by developing flowers . " " So , " Vik asked , " then computers are also ' alive ' ? " She snorted . " Computers are merely tools of human pattern matching . But it 's pattern matching that 's behind every intelligent , conscious human behavior , from language to music to science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him expectantly . " What 's this have to do with Besnoitia ? " As Dr. Steibs shook her head in apparent pity at his intellectual shortcomings , Vik cursed himself for falling into her pedagogic trap . She really was very good . " The patterns recognized by humans , " she said , " are often exceedingly abstract . But anyone infected with Besnoitia loses the ability to work with an entire class of abstract patternsthose that share any significant features with the image of that mite . It 's as if they lived in a world of geometry problems but could never grasp the concept of angles . " At Vik 's obvious confusion , she said , " I 'll give you an example . About thirty years after the discovery of koningmycin , a clerk in a provincial Vital Records department felt there was something odd in recent birth numbers . " Vik tried to hide his surprise . Could Dr. Steibs be describing the A.P . probe 's attack ? The timing would be about right . " The clerk could n't point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces and reviewed their records , again she felt there 'd been a change from past trends . We had no computers then , of course , and statistics was still in its infancy . So it took her several weeks of poring over her records to pin down the strange pattern she had sensed . " The clerk found a very slight increase in the ratio of female to male babies . But not all mothers were affected equally ; those who had been the first-born of their siblings were spared . " Vik swallowed . This was exactly the first-generation effect designed into the A.P . ' s engineered bacterium , to help mask the initial assault . Of the few other attacked worlds that had identified this pattern , none had ever managed the feat before the bacteria 's secondary effects were already well established . Dr. Steibs continued . " The clerk published her findings . Nearly simultaneously , so did four other clerks from four other countries . Still , it took a couple of years to isolate the bacteria responsible , an oddly mutated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked to keep his expression blank as he shook his head . He did n't know how much of this incredible tale he should believe ; not a single previous planet had even confirmed that a bacterium was the cause of their fertility problem-let alone isolated it . " No ? Well , Wolbachta normally infects invertebrates , so this was a bit of a surprise . Even more surprising , this particular strain-which proved remarkably challenging to grow in culture-was resistant to all the usual classes of antibiotics . In the end it was a bit of a race , coming up with a new antibiotic before the bacteria could spread widely enough for its other effect to matter . " " Other effect ? " " Ah-should both parents carry the infection , all of their offspring would be female . I see you recognize the inevitable consequences . " Vik 's expression of horror , though , reflected not sympathy for the aborted genocide Dr. Steibs described , but rather fear of what these people could one day do to his own . Freed of humanity 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had-in just a couple of years-not only detected , but correctly analyzed and then neutralized a weapon whose mere existence had eluded most of its previous targets , a weapon whose effects had never before proven less than catastrophically fatal . Once Nieuw Viaanderen regained space travel , how long until its people threatened the Affiliated Planets ? With such superior pattern-matching abilities , how likely were they to lose any kind of interplanetary battle ? His superiors had been correct to send an investigator here ! But , Vik realized , he now held the power to even those future odds . Once he transmitted a description of Besnoitia and its mite back to Eiriksson-even better , what if he managed to carry home a sample of koningmycin for analysis ? -then his own people could free themselves of the parasite , too . Who knew what insights and breakthroughs might follow ? And what accolades for the humble soldier who 'd brought his people such knowledge ? He was picturing himself at the christening ceremony for a battlecruiser bearing his name , when he realized that Dr. Steibs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see the mites , you can assist in your treatment . After feeding , the mite disengages for 48 hours , until its next blood-meal . You 'll find them lying in your bed-sheets , or hiding in corners . Kill them as you discover them . " " And then I can leave this room ? " She smiled . " 72 hours after the last sighting , yes . Though you 'll still need to complete a full two weeks of the koningmycin to guarantee the eradication of your Besnoitia . " Even as the curtain slid closed , Vik approached the inverted juice glass on the floor . He bent over and lifted the glass , leaving its inhabitant behind . Then he returned the glass to the floor right-sideup-with , as his therapeutic pathology instructor had been fond of saying , extreme prejudice . Vik 's clothing , fumigated and laundered , had preceded his breakfast through the delivery slot this morning . While the maroon turtleneck sweater , black denim trousers , and lightweight boots were barely familiar to him-he 'd chosen the ensemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less than a day-he found their weight and varied fabrics reassuring after a week of flimsy hospital pajamas . When Dr. Steibs opened the curtain he told her , " I 'm going to miss our little chats . " She granted him a slight smile . " I 'm sure that you 'll find your doctor in the rehabilitation clinic at least as entertaining . Or have you recovered your memory since yesterday ? " Vik hurried to don an expression of Deep Concern . " No , nothing at all . " " The Hollebeke clinic has a very good reputation ; they 've managed tougher cases than yours . Still . . . " " What ? " " The train to Hollebeke does n't come through until late this afternoon . You might want to spend the next few hours wandering around town . see if you can stir up any recollections before you leave . " Vik nodded . " We 're done , then ? " He stood . " Apart from some paperwork , yes . " She wagged a finger at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotics . " He patted the trouser pocket that held his bottle of pills . " Do n't worry . I 'm not going to lose these . " Vik turned toward the room 's locked door . " One last thing , " said Dr. Steibs . He turned back . She pointed to her drawings . He had to laugh . " Believe me , Dr. Steibs-after three days of hunting and squashing mites , I 'm never going to forget that pattern ! " She smiled politely . " Humor me . " With a sigh , Vik glanced at the drawings , then back to her . " Still the same pattern . Really . " She reached toward the wall beside her window , pressed some control there . Vik heard a click from the door 's lock . As he turned again toward that door , Dr. Steibs said , " Good luck , Mr. Boeykens . " One day , Vik thought , Dr. Steibs 's descendants were going to wish that his luck had been a good deal worse . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , okay . Good . " Steibs hung up the phone . She clucked her tongue as she stared out her office window . After strolling apparently aimlessly through the village for over an hour , Boeykens had abruptly headed straight for the pub where he 'd originally been picked up . But he spent only a few seconds loitering outside that pub before turning and marching into the nearby woods . The woods where last week they 'd found his spaceship . Until the ship had been discovered , Steibs had n't been as convinced as her colleagues of her patient 's otherworldly origin . But after that discovery-not to mention the analysis of his geneticsshe 'd relinquished any doubts . Steibs sighed . No one could be sure that " Boeykens " came from the same world that had sent the infertility plague . While his DNA did bear many of the same engineering residues as that of the modified Wolbachia , this was at best circumstantial evidence-some other world might have happened to employ the same splicing enzymes . She 'd hoped to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discovery and analysis of the Wolbachia plague ; if he 'd been surprised by her tale , though , he had covered his reaction immediately . He really was very good . Steibs turned back to her computer , where her unfinished report waited . They 'd been fortunate that the bartender had recognized the mite crawling along his counter , and that he 'd so promptly called the health department . She 'd already written a commendation for her assistant 's quick thinking in knocking out Boeykens and hauling him to the hospital . Even so , two-dozen people had needed prophylactic koningmycin , and the bar had to be closed for intensive fumigation . Wherever he came from , Boeykens would presumably soon be flying home to share the discovery of koningmycin with his people . In that , at least , she could take some professional prideshe was a public health officer , after all . Steibs lifted her two drawings from the desk . She winced at the clumsiness of their execution ; still , she felt that she 'd captured the mite pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over teaching Boeykens about Besnoitia and the mite . The military had been against treating him at all , not to mention educating him and handing over samples of koningmycin . In the end , though , it was her colleagues ' plan-conceived , engineered , and put into a freezer half a century ago , against the possibility of someday receiving just such a visitor as Boeykens-that had carried the day . Yes , Boeykens 's people would rid themselves of Besnoitia . And yes , they would therefore gain pattern-matching skills to rival those of Nieuw Vlaanderen . But those skills would never be used to attack her world . Twice a year , for the rest of his life , Boeykens was going to develop a mild respiratory infection . His sneezes were going to expose his colleagues to a very special pair of viruses , both of which should spread quite widely in just a few seasons-unimpaired by koningmycin or any other antibiotic . Then , once a given populace developed a high enough prevalence of the viruses , a very specific side effect would kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sprayed not only with the two viruses but also with , an aerosol mimicking the virus-induced pheromones of an infected population . The side effect had worked perfectly , leaving Steibs confident that her descendants would never meet anyone from Boeykens 's worldunless it were her descendants who took the initiative .

From the time he 'd grown up big enough to get out of the cabin , he 'd made a practice of trying to catch and keep every living thing that ran , flew , jumped , or crawled . Every night before Mama let him go to bed , she 'd make Arliss empty his pockets of whatever he 'd captured during the day . Generally , it would be tangled-up mess of grasshoppers and worms and praying bugs and little rusty tree lizards . ... Sometimes it was stuff like a young bird that had fallen out of its nest before it could fly , or a green-speckled spring frog or a striped water snake . And once he turned out of his pocket a wadded-up baby copperhead that nearly threw Mama into spasms . We never did figure out why the snake had n't bitten him , but Mama took no more chances on snakes . She switched Arliss hard for catching that snake . Then she made me spend better than a week , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snakes . That was all right with Little Arliss . If Mama wanted him to kill his snakes first , he 'd kill them . But that still did n't keep him from sticking them in his pockets along with everything else he 'd captured that day . The snakes might be stinking by the time Mama called on him to empty his pockets , but they 'd be dead . Then , after the yeller dog came , Little Arliss started catching even bigger game . Like cotton-tail rabbits and chaparral birds and a baby possum that sulled and lay like dead for the first several hours until he finally decided that Arliss was n't going to hurt him . Of course , it was Old Yeller doing the catching . He 'd run the game down and turn it over to Little Arliss . Then Little Arliss could come in and tell Mama a big fib about how he caught it himself . I watched them one day when they caught a blue catfish out of Birdsong Creek . The fish had fed out into water so shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I saw it , Old Yeller and Little Arliss did , too . They made a run at it . The fish went scooting away toward deeper water , only Yeller was too fast for him . He pounced on the fish and shut his big mouth down over it and went romping to the bank , where he dropped it down on the grass and let it flop . And here came Little Arliss to fall on it like I guess he 'd been doing everything else . The minute he got his hands on it , the fish finned him and he went to crying . But he would n't turn the fish loose . He just grabbed it up and went running and squawling toward the house , where he gave the fish to Mama . His hands were all bloody by then , where the fish had finned him . They swelled up and got mighty sore . ... But as soon as Mama had wrapped his hands in a poultice of mashed-up prickly-pear root to draw out the poison , Little Arliss forgot all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish for supper , he told the biggest windy I ever heard about how he 'd dived ' way down into a deep hole under the rocks and dragged that fish out and nearly got drowned before he could swim to the bank with it . But when I tried to tell Mama what really happened she would n't let me . " Now , this is Arliss 's story , " she said . " You let him tell it the way he wants to . " I told Mama then , I said : " Mama , that old yeller dog is going to make the biggest liar in Texas out of Little Arliss . " But Mama just laughed at me , like she always laughed at Little Arliss 's big windies after she 'd gotten off where he could n't hear her . ... Well , I hushed then . If Mama wanted Little Arliss to grow up to be the biggest liar in Texas , I guessed it was n't any of my business . All of which , I figure , is what led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Mama had let him tell so many big yarns about his catching live game that he 'd begun to believe them himself . When it happened , I was down the creek a ways , splitting rails to fix up the yard fence . ... Swinging that chopping axe was sure hard work . The sweat poured off me . My back muscles ached . The axe got so heavy I could hardly swing it . My breath got harder and harder to breathe . An hour before sundown , I was worn down to a nub . It seemed like I could n't hit another lick . Papa could have lasted till past sundown , but I did n't see how I could . I shouldered my axe and started toward the cabin , trying to think up some excuse to tell Mama to keep her from knowing I was played clear out . That 's when I heard Little Arliss scream . Well , Little Arliss was a screamer by nature . He 'd scream when he was happy and scream when he was mad and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a noise . Generally , we paid no more mind to his screaming than we did to the gobble of a wild turkey . But this time was different . The second I heard his screaming , I felt my heart flop clear over . This time I knew Little Arliss was in real trouble . I tore out up the trail leading toward the cabin . A minute before , I 'd been so tired out with my rail splitting that I could n't have struck a trot . But now I raced through the tall trees in that creek bottom , covering ground like a scared wolf . Little Arliss 's second scream , when it came , was louder and shriller and more frantic-sounding than the first . Mixed with it was a whimpering crying sound that I knew did n't come from him . It was a sound I 'd heard before and seemed like I ought to know what it was , but right then I could n't place it . Then , from way off to one side came a sound that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a charging bear . I 'd just heard it once in my life . That was the time Mama had shot and wounded a hog-killing bear and Papa had had to finish it off with a knife to keep it from getting her . My heart went to pushing up into my throat , nearly choking off my wind . I strained for every lick of speed I could get out of my running legs . I did n't know what sort of fix Little Arliss had got himself into , but I knew that it had to do with a mad bear , which was enough . The way the late sun slanted through the trees had the trail all cross-banded with streaks of bright light and dark shade . I ran through these bright and dark patches so fast that the changing light nearly blinded me . Then suddenly , I raced out into the open where I could see ahead . And what I saw sent a chill clear through to the marrow of my bones . There was Little Arliss , down in that spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the water , holding onto the hind leg of a little black bear cub no bigger than a small coon . The bear cub was out on the bank , whimpering and crying and clawing the rock with all three of his other feet , trying to pull away . But Little Arliss was holding on for all he was worth , scared now and screaming his head off . Too scared to let go . How come the bear cub ever to prowl close enough for Little Arliss to grab him , I do n't know . And why he did n't turn on him and bite loose , I could n't figure out , either . Unless he was like Little Arliss , too scared to think . But all of that did n't matter now . What mattered was the bear cub 's mama . She 'd heard the cries of her baby and was coming to save him . She was coming so fast that she had the brush popping and breaking as she crashed through and over it . I could see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far side of Birdsong Creek . She was roaring mad and ready to kill . And worst of all , I could see that I 'd never get there in time ! Mama could n't either . She 'd heard Arliss , too , and here she came from the cabin , running down the slant toward the spring , screaming at Arliss , telling him to turn the bear cub loose . But Little Arliss would n't do it . All he 'd do was hang with that hind leg and let out one shrill shriek after another as fast as he could suck in a breath . Now the she bear was charging across the shallows in the creek . She was knocking sheets of water high in the bright sun , charging with her fur up and her long teeth bared , filling the canyon with that awful coughing roar . And no matter how fast Mama ran or how fast I ran , the she bear was going to get there first ! I think I nearly went blind then , picturing what was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth to scream and not any sound came out . Then , just as the bear went lunging up the creek bank toward Little Arliss and her cub , a flash of yellow came streaking out of the brush . It was that big yeller dog . He was roaring like a mad bull . He was n't one third as big and heavy as the she bear , but when he piled into her from one side , he rolled her clear off her feet . They went down in a wild , roaring tangle of twisting bodies and scrambling feet and slashing fangs . As I raced past them , I saw the bear lunge up to stand on her hind feet like a man while she clawed at the body of the yeller dog hanging to her throat . I did n't wait to see more . Without ever checking my stride , I ran in and jerked Little Arliss loose from the cub . I grabbed him by the wrist and yanked him up out of that water and slung him toward Mama like he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Grab him , Mama ! Grab him and run ! " Then I swung my chopping axe high and wheeled , aiming to cave in the she bear 's head with the first lick . But I never did strike . I did n't need to . Old Yeller had n't let the bear get close enough . He could n't handle her ; she was too big and strong for that . She 'd stand there on her hind feet , hunched over , and take a roaring swing at him with one of those big front claws . She 'd slap him head over heels . She 'd knock him so far that it did n't look like he could possibly get back there before she charged again , but he always did . He 'd hit the ground rolling , yelling his head off with the pain of the blow ; but somehow he 'd always roll to his feet . And here he 'd come again , ready to tie into her for another round . I stood there with my axe raised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the house , I heard Mama calling : " Come away from there , Travis . Hurry , son ! Run ! " That spooked me . Up till then , I 'd been ready to tie into that bear myself . Now , suddenly , I was scared out of my wits again . I ran toward the cabin . But like it was , Old Yeller nearly beat me there . I did n't see it of course ; but Mama said that the minute Old Yeller saw we were all in the clear and out of danger , he threw the fight to that she bear and lit out for the house . The bear chased him for a little piece , but at the rate Old Yeller was leaving her behind , Mama said it looked liked the bear was backing up . But if the big yeller dog was scared or hurt in any way when he came dashing into the house , he did n't show it . He sure did n't show it like we all did . Little Arliss had hushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinging to Mama like he 'd never let her go . And Mama was sitting in the middle of the floor , holding him up close and crying like she 'd never stop . And me , I was close to crying , myself . Old Yeller , though , all he did was come bounding in to jump on us and lick us in the face and bark so loud that there , inside the cabin , the noise nearly made us deaf . The way he acted , you might have thought that bear fight had n't been anything more than a rowdy romp that we 'd all taken part in for the fun of it .

@@4021959 CHAPTER1 // Fire engulfed the church , radiating such heat that the snow falling around it was vaporized instantly . Julianna Whitney stood a moment and stared at the flames eating their way through the roof and licking fiery tongues from the shattered remnants of stained glass windows . Four inches of fresh snow had fallen since the storm had begun , but this close to the fire it was melting away . The dusting of flakes on her hair turned to beads of moisture as she glanced around the little island village . // The church was not the only building on fire . There was another large structure that might once have been an office or shop , whose elegantly detailed front porch had now been burned black , embers glowing in the wood . A couple of small cottages were also ablaze . // A handful of people-no more than a dozen-had gathered in the center of the village to watch the conflagration . They hung back as though afraid the fire would engulf them . None of them so much as looked at Julianna , but she frowned as she studied them . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them had looked abandoned , but could there really be so few people living on this island ? // The gray sky hung low and heavy , and with the blanket of snow muffling all sounds , the whole island had a claustrophobic feel . When the sound of cracking wood split the sky , Julianna jumped as though it had been a gunshot. // But it was only the roof of the church buckling . Red embers sprayed into the sky . // A strong hand grabbed her arm and pulled her backward , and she turned to glare at the man who 'd taken hold of her . It was Halliwell , his sad eyes dark with confusion . // Julianna shook herself free . " Do n't do that , okay ? " // Halliwell gave her a look as cold as the storm . " You were too close . " // Before she could respond there came another crack of wood and then a splintering noise , accompanied by the hiss of the fire . Julianna spun to see the church roof buckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , part of it crashing down inside the blazing ruin . But the top of the steeple struck the ground only a few feet from where she had been standing , the fire sending up tendrils of steam as it hit the snow . // For a moment she could only stare at the ground , then she let out a shuddering breath and glanced at Halliwell . " Thank you . " // The detective replied with an almost imperceptible shrug , then turned to survey the village , as though he was back in Maine and this was just another case . Halliwell was thus far doing an excellent job of pretending he was undisturbed by what they had seen as they arrived at Canna Island . They 'd come halfway around the world in search of Oliver Bascombe on a journey financed by the law firm of Bascombe & Cox . Halliwell was a homicide detective , moonlighting for the firm because Oliver was wanted for questioning in connection with the murder of his father . Julianna was an attorney working full time as a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fianc. // He had disappeared shortly before his father 's murder-gone missing in the middle of the night , in a snowstorm far worse than the one currently assailing Canna Island . Then , on the night of Max Bascombe 's murder , Oliver 's sister , Collette , had gone missing as well . There was so much more-theories that Halliwell had , imagined connections to the mutilation murders of dozens of children around the world-but there could be no answers to any of those questions until Oliver was found . The murder of one of its founders had been ugly enough ; if there was to be more bad publicity , the firm wanted to be in a position to do some spin control . // Julianna and Halliwell had tracked Oliver here and paid a local man an absurd sum of money to take them out to the island in the midst of the storm . On their arrival , they had been rewarded with a brief glimpse of Oliver as he strode toward them-toward the dock-with the fires beginning to burn in the village behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been accompanied by a man with blue feathers in his hair , an Asian woman wearing a copper-red fur cloak , and a man made entirely of ice . // She and Halliwell had not discussed that particular topic , but she was not prone to hallucination . She knew precisely what she had seen , and that man had not been a mirage. // Then the ice man had stretched out a hand and drawn a kind of oval ; the air there had begun to shimmer , and Oliver and his companions had simply stepped out of this world , disappearing one after the other . // Halliwell spoke her name . The man was a curmudgeon by nature , gruff and distant . But somehow the events of the previous few minutes had created a connection between them that had not existed before . For when he spoke to her now , Halliwell seemed almost gentle . // " Focus , " he said . // Julianna did . " What happened here ? " // The detective glanced at the islanders who had gathered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My name is Ted Halliwell . I 'm a police detective from the U.S. Anyone have any idea how these fires began ? " // Blank faces stared back at him . Several people began to whisper to one another . Others started to walk away , eyes averted , as though the last thing they wanted was for Halliwell to talk to them . // Halliwell shook his head as he turned back to her . " Had a feeling that was going to be useless . I know from back home that islanders are xenophobic as hell , but this is different . I think they saw something , all right , and it is n't just that they do n't want to talk to outsiders about it . They do n't want to talk about it at all . " // Julianna glanced at the people . Some of them were no more than gray shapes in the storm . More had begun to drift away , going back to their lives . She wondered if any of them had had their homes destroyed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming from the mainland in this storm . // Embers floated and danced with the falling snow . // " Let 's keep looking , " Halliwell said . He stared at Julianna , waiting for her reply . When she nodded , the detective started around the church , moving toward the large building whose beautifully carved porch was little more than charred kindling now . // " Wait ! " a voice called . // A lone woman strode toward them even as the other islanders retreated into the storm . Her grim features were cast into even sharper angles by the firelight. // " Do you know what happened here ? " Halliwell asked her . // The woman ignored him , focusing on Julianna . " You 'd be looking for them what came before . The young man and his friends-the fox girl and the others . " // Julianna shivered and hugged herself , the thick coat suddenly not enough to protect her from the cold . Or perhaps this chill came from within . // " That 's right , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw ? " Halliwell urged . " It 's not a difficult question . " // But the woman only narrowed her eyes and gazed at Julianna . " They 've gone . Came to see the professor , and this is what comes of it . Maybe that 's the end , though . No more strangers on the island . Better for everyone if you just let us clean up the mess . Turn round and go back to the mainland . Those you seek have gone . " // Halliwell sighed and gestured to indicate that since the woman was ignoring him , Julianna should ask the questions . // She narrowed her eyes and gazed at the woman . " What professor ? Where is he ? " // The woman scowled and pointed . " Continue on the way you 're going if you must , but you wo n't like what you find . " // Then she turned and strode away without a single backward glance . Julianna watched until she had left the main square , then turned to find Halliwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out slowly . // " Let 's go , " she said . // Halliwell nodded and together they continued on toward the building whose porch was now crumbling in flames . Bits of the ornate woodwork had burned away completely . Railings had fallen , withering in the fire . The flames glowed within the gutted structure , its windows like the eyes of some gigantic jack o ' lantern . // The burning church was behind them now , along with the two other houses of worship and a number of cottages . Julianna felt the chill of the storm , the snow whipping around her face as the wind picked up , but as they neared this other fire , its heat made her feel as though the skin on her face was stretched too tight . // " What is that ? " Halliwell said , his voice barely audible over the hungry roar of the blaze . // Julianna picked up her pace . Her boots slid in the slushy melting snow . To the left of the burning building was an old rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones piled up decades-or perhaps centuries-earlier as some sort of boundary . It lined a path . In the firelight they could clearly see a cottage at the end . The little house had been destroyed recently enough that there was only a dusting of snowfall on the shattered interior , now exposed to the elements . // Fire had not been the culprit here . At first glance she thought an explosion had taken place , but then realized that much of the debris had caved inward rather than blowing outward . // Yet she spared only a moment 's thought for the cottage . // It was the carnage that drew her attention . In the diffuse daylight that filtered through the storm and the bright glare of the fire , they could easily make out motionless figures scattered on the ground , shrouded in a thin layer of fresh snowfall . Dark stains spread out from the corpses , and already a frost was beginning to form on the puddles of blood . There was something odd about the corpses , but Julianna could not focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . // Because there was another corpse in their midst that made her breath catch in her throat . She could only stare at the creature-for she could not think of it as a man-impaled upon jagged stalagmites of ice that jutted from the ground . Thin , frozen blades punctured the creature 's leg and side , shot up through its chest and belly and skull . . . and wings . // Julianna could only stare . Though it had the shape of a man , its upper body and head were that of some giant bird of prey , and its wings were enormous , dark-feathered things . // " My God , " Halliwell rasped beside her . " This ca n't be real . None of it . " // He started forward and knelt by the nearest corpse , brushed away the snow to find orange-and-black fur beneath , and a snout full of deadly fangs . The dead man was not a man at all , but some kind of tiger that walked like a man . // " You mean like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he and the others just disappeared , like they were stepping right out of the world ? " Julianna asked , staring at him . After a moment she glanced at the tiger-man again , and then at the bird-thing impaled on the ice . " You said we 'd follow , wherever they went , Ted . You 've got a whole lot of mysteries on your hands , not just with Max Bascombe 's murder and the little girl in Cottingsley , but with the other children you think are connected to this killer who 's removing their eyes . I 'm having just as hard a time with this as you are , but you ca n't turn back now . " // Halliwell 's expression darkened . " Who said anything about turning back ? I 'm not going anywhere .

" Mother wanted to know what movie we 'd be seeing . " // Uh-oh . Red alert . Red alert . // " Oh ? " // " Seems she 's been dying to see the same movie . You do n't mind if we swing by and pick her up after we catch a bite here , do you ? You 'd be doing me an immense favor . " // Debra swore under her breath as she saw his lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be okay , " she responded , realizing she 'd lied more on dates in the last six months than she had in her entire life up to that point , and predicting another in the form of a sudden , killer migraine in the queue . She started to rub her forehead when her cell phone rang . // " Hello ? Yes , this is Debra Daniels . Who is this ? Randall who ? A Realtor ? I 'm sorry . I do n't need a Realtor . My father ? My father gave you my number ? When ? Where ? What ! Just a minute . " Debra stood . " Will you excuse me for just a second , Howard ? " She motioned at her phone . Howard nodded and she slipped into the hallway by the restrooms . " Where did you see my dad ? At the club ? My father gave you my number in the men 's locker room at the country club ? He said what ? No ! No , I am not interested in going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure . I do n't care what my father said . That 's right . I 'm not interested . What 's that ? No ! No , I do n't have any property to list ! Good-bye ! " // Debra snapped the phone shut . " I do not believe this ! " She took a shaky breath . // It was bad enough her mother had had business cards made up for Debra and handed them out like missing-person flyers ; having her father finagle dates for her in the locker room at the club over stinky sweat socks , wet towels , soiled jockey shorts , and dirty nut cups was the limit . The absolute limit . Her dad , her supportive , " shop around , kiddo " comrade , had sold out . He 'd formed an alliance with the other tribe and left her all alone in the crosshairs of a loaded-forbear , matchmaking mama with a mission . // Dear God , somehow she had to find a boyfriend . And not just any boyfriend . A boyfriend who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would n't make any demands upon her time or her person . A man who was successful in his own right and was n't emotionally needy or financially greedy . A man who would continue to let her live her life just as she pleased . She sighed . Where on earth would she find such ... perfection ? // Debra suddenly remembered her date and hurried back to the table . She sat and picked up her napkin and looked over to find Howard the Head Librarian doodling knives and nooses on his dinner napkin . She groaned and put her head in her hands . Maybe her earlier idea about Inflatable Ian was n't much off the mark . // Two hours later , citing a headache from hell , Debra stomped through the food court of the mall , her mood as sour as one of those rancid Tearjerker gumballs her nephews , Stephen and Shawn , kept trying to foist off on her . She 'd become an object of sympathy . The target of speculation . A cause for concern . And why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers . Was n't Tweedledum to some man 's Tweedledee . She shook her head , still not believing her loyal , sympathetic father had stooped to enter his own handpicked stud in the Debra Daniels Dating Derby . The last thing her father needed was to fret and worry over her love life . He 'd suffered a mild heart attack several months earlier , and , although he seemed to be recovering well from the angioplasty , added worry could n't be good . // Debra swore under her breath . She had to put an end to this out-of-control manhunt . But how ? It was n't as if she had n't been trying to find her soul mate . She had-and had the dating rsum to prove it . But so far Mr. Right had n't stepped forward for consideration . Debra frowned . She did n't think she could use a poor , unsuspecting schlub as some kind of dating talisman to ward off maniacal matchmakers . She bit her lip . Hmmm . Maybe she could pay a guy to pose as her significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was n't that illegal in some states ? Besides , it would never work . If Mr. Right was n't the real McCoy , her parents would see through him quicker than Debra herself saw through most politicians . // She frowned and considered the alternatives . She supposed she could settle for another subpar , real , honest-to-goodness boyfriend . Her lip curled . After ten years of dating one bozo after another who thought monogamous meant one woman per sexual encounter , of enduring pretty boys who were more enamored with themselves than with her , and of fending off octopus arms and blowfish lips , she suspected her best friend was right : The good men were either married or gay . Anyone who still believed that there was a prince at the end of all that frog kissing was having seriously messed-up Disney delusions of a fairy-tale world that did n't exist . // Several months earlier , in her first very promising courtship in a long time , Debra was almost convinced she 'd found the One : state trooper Thomas Talbot . Anticipating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new level of commitment , Debra waited to hear the magic words that could terminate her mother 's matchmaking preoccupation forever . // " Debra , would you believe I 'm gon na be a daddy ? " Trooper Thomas had asked instead , not on one knee holding flowers and candy , but via the answering machine with a police radio blaring in the background . Trooper Thomas had knocked up a Springfield police sergeant 's daughter-who just so happened to be a city attorney . A shotgun wedding-hosted by the father of the bride , of course-was planned . // That same day , Debra began to compile a list of her minimum requirements for the position of Mr. Right . But finding a man who fit the bill had , so far , proven tricky , and Debra was ready to concede the possibility that the position might go unfilled-which was , Debra again assured herself , not the end of the world . After all , she had a very nice life . She had a pleasant home , plenty of good friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loving family that included a mother , father , grandma , brother and sister-in-law , and two mischievous nephews who , when they were n't driving her crazy , were really very nice . // Maybe now would be a good time to go for that supervisor promotion at work , Debra decided . It was possible-at least for the short term-that might take her mother 's mind off messy matrimonial matters as her daughter took on greater vocational responsibilities . Debra was ready to try anything . // Debra entered a gift shop and sucked in the yummy scent of vanilla candles and dark-roast coffee . Her best friend , Suzi , had a birthday coming up-one of those awful ones that ended in a zero : the big three-oh . A milestone for an unmarried woman . Or was that millstone ? // Debra wanted to pick out something extra-special for her bummed-out friend , as she herself had just recently hit that age . She browsed the shelves , sniffing a candle here and picking up a novelty item there . She paused at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out plastic poop and bogus barf to one another . Debra smiled . Ah , youth . // She cast an eye at the end of the top shelf . A bright orange and neon green box caught her attention .

They 'd talked a bit through e-mail , and then by phone . Lilli could hardly believe it when Caroline had admitted what it was she did for a living , managing Exotica . But the idea had become more and more intriguing , until finally , Lilli had n't been able to resist Caroline 's repeated invitations . // Was she really going to this place ?

Or maybe it was simply old habit , one instilled by Evan , to question herself , to worry . // Stop it . // She tapped her fingers on the armrest , her pulse racing as she stared out the window .

" We 're here , Madame . " // A pair of enormous iron gates rolled back in front of the car . Imposing . Beautiful . Her stomach gave one hard twist . There was no sign here . The resort was far too exclusive , too discreet for that . Nothing more than those big gates closing it off from the rest of the world . Almost another world in itself . // They drove past sweeping lawns with peacocks wandering beneath the palm trees . Gorgeous hedges of blooming bougainvillea in shades of red and pink climbed the high stone walls on either side .

The same beautiful , sculpted face and striking blue eyes she remembered . Caroline had hardly changed at all since they 'd met in college . // Her friend leaned in and gave her a hug , enveloping her in warm , spicy scent . She stood back , and Caroline smiled at her . " Welcome to Exotica. " // " It 's so good to see you . You look wonderful . " // " So do you .

But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here in the sun . " // She followed Caroline up a wide , shallow staircase and into the cool interior of the building . Inside , it was all sparse , calm elegance . High ceilings made the space feel airy . Polished tile floors led to a high , curved reception desk made of some light-colored wood . // An attractive young woman greeted Lilli from behind it . " Welcome , Ms. DeForrest. " // " Samantha , please see that Ms. DeForrest 's luggage is sent to the Kama Sutra suite . " // " Yes , Caroline . Right away . " // " Would you like to see a little of the grounds before I take you to your suite ? " // " I 'd love to . This place is . . . intriguing . " // Caroline smiled at her . " Come with me , then .

Bronze statues of male nudes done in classical Greek style stood sentry at each corner . They were graceful . Erotic . A faint pulse of heat beat deep in Lilli 's body , just looking at these statues , thinking about what she was doing here . // Caroline made a sweeping gesture . " Exotica is very much like an adult Disneyland . Each of our fantasy suites are like tiny cities done in different themes , with servants ' quarters , background players , the appropriate architectural details . See there ? You can see the tower of the Medieval Castle over the wall . That 's our largest section , where guests share the main castle with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time . It 's very popular .

Amazing really . " // " We do everything we can to make the fantasy as real as possible , to make it all come alive . We want you to immerse yourself . That 's why our companions work on bimonthly rotations , with thorough medical checks in between . Condoms break the fantasy far too easily .

It was as open and airy as the reception area had been , with tall banks of tinted windows overlooking the lawns . Caroline gestured to a pair of creamy leather couches , but Lilli paced the floor instead , gazing out the window , as Caroline went to the intercom on her sleek glass-topped desk to ring for drinks . // " Lilli , you 're as wound up as a clock . Come sit down with me on the sofa and tell me what I can do to make you more comfortable . " // " I . . . I 'm not sure . This sounded so wonderful when you first told me about it .

But here I am , nonetheless , about to face my fortieth birthday and not feeling great about myself . Part of what I 'd like to accomplish this week is to feel more confident . Less hard on myself .

How could anyone work in such a place and remain so unaffected by what went on here ? " Is it because . . . of what happened with Jeff ? That ability to distance yourself ? " // Caroline blinked , looked away . // " I 'm sorry , Caroline . It 's not my place to bring that up . " // " No . It 's fine .

Not that you did n't have every right to . I know it 's none of my business . . . " // " No , it 's alright . There is n't anyone else I can talk to about it . And it 's been so good talking with you this last year , reconnecting . I 've needed a friend . " // " So have I.

" Well , maybe that just makes me the perfect person for the job . " // " Maybe . " But Lilli was n't so sure of that . // A soft knock at the door and a uniformed maid brought in a tray with two tall glasses of iced tea , a small bowl of sugar , and another full of lemon slices . // " Thank you , Marcy . " Caroline held a glass out to Lilli , then took one for herself and squeezed a lemon wedge into it . // Lilli sipped her tea . " I just wish I could calm down and relax .

He had black hair-not dark , not sable , and not any shade of brown , but raven black-cut in a layered , neat style of medium length with short sideburns and a natural widow 's peak as rare as it was dramatic . // His eyes were such a light gray they appeared almost silver , very sharp and vibrant , and they were set beneath winged brows as dramatic and memorable as the widow 's peak . The rest of his face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect nose , and a mouth that was utterly masculine and filled with sensuality and humor . He had a strong jaw that showed a great deal of character and perhaps just a touch of stubbornness . // All in all , it was a remarkable face . // Josie knew she stared up at him for only a few seconds , but it seemed much longer . Clearing her throat , she managed to say , " It 's all right-I 'd just forgotten you were staying at the cottage . That is , if you 're the owner ? " // He nodded and smiled . " Marc Westbrook. " // " Westbrook ? " // " An ancestor built the house back in the thirties , " he explained . " It 's been in the family , one way or another , ever since . " // " I see . " Gathering her scattered wits , she noticed two things then . One , that he was carrying Pendragon , and two , that his left arm-the one he was using to cradle the cat-was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had missed both those rather obvious facts while she 'd stared at him like an idiot , it said a great deal about the effect he had on her . // For heaven 's sake , she had noted the lack of a wedding band while completely missing the cast and the cat ! // Belatedly recalling her manners , she extended a hand . " I 'm Josie Douglas . " She no longer expected people to react to the name ; Douglas was fairly common , after all , and without the singularity of her father 's name to stir memories , few knew who she was . // " Welcome to Westbrook , Josie Douglas , " he replied . // His grip was firm but careful , the touch of a powerful man wary of his own physical strength . It was probably usual for him to be cautious because big men often were , she thought , but she also knew that she did look a bit fragile . // She had long considered it her curse that she frequently roused protective instincts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was slender , small-boned , and always pale . She looked helpless , apparently . Never mind that she seldom needed help and even more rarely wanted it ; few males asked , they simply tried to help her . // The handshake lasted just a bit longer than necessary , and Josie could have sworn her flesh actually tingled when the contact with his was broken . Ridiculous . Of course it 's ridiculous . What on earth was wrong with her ? // Conjuring up what she hoped was an impersonal smile , she said , " I met Pendragon a couple of hours ago . " // " Met him ? I thought he was yours , " Marc Westbrook said , with a glance down at the cat in his arms . // " That 's why I came over here , to return him to you . " // She looked into the enigmatic china-blue eyes of the big black cat , then shook her head . " No , he just showed up a couple of hours ago . But he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't think so , he 's been too well fed-and he certainly does n't have the beat-up , ragged appearance of a stray tomcat . But I 've been out here for nearly two months , and the first I saw of him was when he rattled my screen door a few minutes ago . " He set the cat on the mailbox platform , and Pendragon curled his tail around his forepaws and regarded them both placidly. // His eyes were definitely odd for a black cat , Josie reflected . They were Siamese eyes , vibrant blue and just faintly crossed , yet he did n't show any other sign of Oriental ancestry . He was large-boned and solid rather than slender , and his glossy black coat did n't have so much as a speck of white anywhere that she could see . And he was unusually large , weighing every ounce of what Josie guessed to be twenty pounds . // " Do you suppose he belongs to one of the neighbors , then ? " Josie suggested , but rather doubtfully . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neighbors are few and far between . Most of the land around these parts is pastured . There 's a horse farm about two miles or so from here-they raise Thoroughbreds-and maybe half a dozen houses within a ten-mile radius , but that 's it . " // Josie knew ; one of the reasons she 'd picked this place was its virtual isolation . Of course , that was when she 'd imagined the owner of Westbrook as being some elderly man , a widower , perhaps , who was renting out the main house because it had gotten too big for him , or something like that . But she should have asked . She really should have asked . Because she certainly had n't expected a devastatingly handsome man somewhere in his mid-thirties with vivid eyes and a lazy voice who liked cats and seemed to have time on his hands . . . . // What a landlord . // " He might belong to somebody around here , " Marc Westbrook was going on , " but I would n't know who to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Then I guess we should give him the run of the place and see if he sticks around . If he does . . . an ad in the local paper asking if anyone 's missing a black cat ? " // " Suits me . We 'll give it a few days . As a matter of fact , it 's nice to have a cat around . " // " They 're good company , " she agreed . " And Pendragon seems very polite . " // Marc smiled . " Agreed . So , we 'll wait and see . And we 'll let him decide whose bed he takes over at night . " // There was a brief silence that Josie found a bit unnerving . Casting about , she gestured slightly toward his left arm and asked , " An accident ? " // " So they said . A drunk driver crossed over the median and I could n't get out of his way . " // " I 'm sorry . " // " So was he . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he continued in a lighter tone . " As far as I was concerned , it was n't all bad . I had n't had a vacation in years , and I had n't realized how badly I needed one until I spent most of the first couple of weeks sleeping . The injuries were relatively simple ; the ribs knit , and the cast came off my leg two weeks ago , so all I have to put up with is the inconvenience of having a cast on my left arm . " // " You 're left-handed ? " // " Would n't you know it ? Murphy 's law . But even it 's better now than it was ; the damn thing started out covering the entire arm . " // The explanation answered Josie 's major question , but she asked anyway . " So you 're convalescing ? " // " That 's the idea . My doctor thought I would n't rest in the city-I work in Richmond-so knowing I owned this property , he insisted I exile myself out here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best friend from college , so he considers it his right to push me around . " // Josie had the shrewd notion that nobody pushed Marc Westbrook around , not even his best friend , but she did n't say so . Instead she said , " I 'd say this would be a good place to heal . Quiet . Peaceful . " // His mouth twisted slightly , and the silvery eyes gleamed with amusement . " Yeah , right . Miles away from everything , and too far out for cable ; so far , I 've resisted the lure of a satellite dish , but it 's only a matter of time until I give in to my lesser self . For the first time since college , I 'm caught up on my reading , and I 've discovered a dozen new ways to play solitaire. " // " Bored ? " // " Well , let 's put it this way-the arrival of the mailman is the high point of my day ; I have all the Richmond newspapers sent out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His smile became even more crooked . " Until the accident , I led the very busy , not to say frantic , lifestyle of a criminal lawyer , and all this peace and quiet is driving me nuts . " // She was amused and not unsympathetic , but also a bit uneasy . While there was nothing wrong with having an attractive man nearby-she was a normal woman , after all-she had an awful lot to do and only a year in which to do it , and she certainly did n't want anyone looking over her shoulder while she did it . Particularly not a criminal lawyer . Of course , since Marc was obviously recovered except for the arm , he would no doubt be returning to Richmond and work soon . // Probing as delicately as possible , she asked , " It wo n't be much longer , surely ? I mean , after two months ? " // " If my friend the doctor has his way , a few more weeks . This cast is due to come off in thirteen days-precisely-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weeks before he has to admit I 'm fit for work . " // Josie could n't help smiling , but her amusement changed to embarrassment when he went on dryly. // " So you do n't have to be afraid I 'll make a nuisance of myself for too long . " // " I didn't- " // He chuckled , a low sound of genuine amusement . " No , you did n't say so , but I do n't blame you for wondering . I 'll admit , finding out I 'd have a tenant in the house raised my spirits a bit , and I do hope you wo n't get too upset with me if I borrow a cup of sugar now and then-but I promise I wo n't try to use you to alleviate my boredom . " // " Fair enough . " She managed to keep her voice light , but she knew her face was still filled with color because she could feel the heat . It was another of her curses ; her skin was very pale , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gave her away every time , dammit . But at least he did n't comment . // " Good . Now-that said , can I help you unload the van ? " // Josie had brought the first load of her belongings to the house early this morning ; this was the second and final load , and it was a bit sobering that all her worldly possessions-except for quite a few boxes of books that were in storage-could be stuffed in the cramped space of two vans . . . . She glanced behind her at the vehicle , still about a quarter full , then at her watch . It was almost five , and with winter approaching , it would soon be dark . // She hesitated for an instant , then said , " I think I 'll leave the rest until tomorrow . " // Mildly , he said , " I can manage pretty well even with the cast , you know . " // Josie eyed him . " I do n't doubt it . But I 've had enough for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make some coffee-would you like some ? " // " I 'd love some , " he accepted promptly . " Even with a coffee maker , I do n't seem to have the knack . " // " How do you know I do ? " she asked in a wry tone as she reached back to close the van 's side door . // " I don't-but the odds say your coffee has to be better than mine . " // " We 'll see . " But she was n't too worried , because the truth was she knew she could make very good coffee . She used a specially blended fresh-ground variety filled with taste . And a percolator. // As if he had understood their conversation , Pendragon jumped down from his perch and preceded them up the sidewalk to the house , his tail high . Dignified . // Josie had a hunch that the cat would indeed stick around , for a while , and that a newspaper ad would produce no one who had misplaced a beloved pet . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride even greater than usual for a feline , and it spoke of self-sufficiency . Still , someone had certainly fastened the decorative collar around his neck and provided a name tag . . . . // He had been somebody 's cat long enough to earn himself a peculiar name , at least . // She dismissed thoughts of the cat as they went into the house , leading the way through the jumble of boxes and furniture still under dustcovers while Marc followed her . // " I should have had this place cleaned before you moved in , " he said suddenly . " The last time must have been right after the interior was painted , and that was six months ago . I 'd forgotten how dusty a house could get . " // She glanced back over her shoulder to see him frowning slightly as he looked around . " A little dust certainly is n't going to hurt me , " she told him . " Besides , I 'm sure I 'll settle in better if I spend the first few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to know a house . " // " I could get somebody out here- " // " No , please , I 'd rather do it myself . " She pushed open the swinging door leading to the kitchen . // Following , Marc said , " If you 're sure . " He looked around at the bright kitchen , which boasted a line of windows along one side to admit plenty of light , and was painted a cheerful pale yellow . The remodeling work had gone well in here , he decided , and the decision to practically rebuild the room had definitely been the right one . // All the appliances were new , as well as the deep double sink and sparkling fixtures ; the tile countertops had been redone in a lovely white marbleized pattern , and the original old wooden table in the center of the spacious room had been replaced by a combination breakfast bar and work island . But even with all the improvements , the room still retained the cheeriness and warmth Marc remembered from his childhood . // @ @ 
@@4022001 1 // 14,000 years ago // The legends say that when the blood of the Wide Valley wolves mingles with the blood of the wolves outside the valley , the wolf who bears that blood will stand forever between two worlds . It is said that such a wolf holds the power to destroy not only her pack , but all of wolfkind . That 's the real reason Ruuqo came to kill my brother , my sisters , and me in the faint light of the early morning four weeks after we were born . // Wolves hate killing pups . It 's considered unnatural and repulsive , and most wolves would rather chew off their own paws than hurt a pup . But my mother never should have whelped us . She was not a senior wolf , and therefore had no right to have pups . But that could have been forgiven . Much worse than that , she had broken one of the most important rules of the Wide Valley , the rules that protect our bloodlines . Ruuqo was only doing his duty . // He had already given Rissa a bellyful of pups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pack . Unless given permission by the leaderwolves , no other wolf may mate , for extra pups can be difficult to feed unless it is a very good year . The year I was born was a time of conflict in our valley , and prey was growing scarce . We shared the Wide Valley with four other packs of wolves and with several tribes of humans . While most of the other wolves respected the boundaries of our territories , the humans did not -- they drove us from our own kills whenever they got the chance . So the Swift River pack did not have food to spare the season I was born . Even so , I do n't think my mother truly believed that Ruuqo would hurt us . She must have hoped he would n't notice our Outsider blood , that he would n't smell it on us. // Just before dawn two days before Ruuqo came to end our lives , my brother , Triell , and I climbed eagerly up the incline of soft , cool dirt that led from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the deep hollow of the den , and yips and growls from the wolves outside echoed off the walls of our home . The scents and sounds of the world above intrigued us , and anytime we were n't eating or sleeping , we were trying to sneak outside . // " Wait , " our mother had told us , blocking our way , " there are things you must know first . " // " We just want to see what 's out there , " Triell wheedled . I caught the mischievous glint in his eye , and we tried to dash past her . // " Listen . " Our mother placed a large paw over us , pressing us to the ground . " Every pup must pass inspection to be allowed into the pack . If you do not pass , you do not live . You must listen to what I teach you . " Her voice , usually soft and comforting , held a worried tone I 'd never heard before . " When you meet Ruuqo and Rissa , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . You must prove that you are worthy to be part of the Swift River pack . And you must show them respect and honor . " She released us , gave us one more worried look , and bent to wash my sisters , who had followed us up to the mouth of the den . Triell and I retreated to a corner of the warm den to plan what we would do to become part of the pack . I do n't think it occurred to me that we could fail . // Two days later , when at last we emerged from the den , we saw Rissa 's five pups already stumbling around the clearing . Two weeks older than we , they were ready to be presented to the pack and given their names . Rissa stood slightly back , watching , as Ruuqo looked over the pups . Our mother hurried us to join them , though our weak legs made us stagger. // Mother stopped as she looked around the small , dusty clearing . " Rissa is letting Ruuqo make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her muzzle pulled tight with anxiety . " Bow to him . You must show him respect and win his favor . The more you please him , the better your chances at survival . " Her voice grew harsh . " Listen , pups . You must please him , and you will live . " // The world outside the den was a jumble of unfamiliar and intriguing smells . The scent of the pack was the most powerful and exciting . All around us , wolves had gathered to watch the pup welcoming . At least six different wolf-scents mingled with the smell of leaves and tree and earth , confusing our noses and making us sneeze . The warm , sweet air beckoned , drawing us out and away from the safety of our mother 's side . She followed , whining softly . // Ruuqo looked at our mother and then looked away , his gray face unreadable . His own pups , all of whom were bigger and fatter than we , yipped and trembled around him , licking his lowered muzzle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One by one he sniffed them , turned them just a little this way and that , carefully checking for disease or weakness . After a moment , he accepted all but one of them into the pack by taking each small muzzle gently in his mouth . // " Welcome pups , " he said . " You are part of the Swift River pack , and each wolf of the pack will protect you and will feed you . Welcome Borlla . Welcome Unnan . Welcome Reel . Welcome Marra . You are our future . You are Swift River wolves . " He ignored one small , raggedy pup , leaving him to the side and refusing him a name . Once a pup is named , every wolf in the pack is pledged to protect him , so the leaderwolves do not name a pup they think might die soon . Rissa crawled back into her den and brought out one limp form , a tiny pup that had not survived to greet the pack . She buried it quickly at the edge of the clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . Each wolf bounded up to the pups in turn to welcome them to the pack , tails wagging and ears pricked in delight . Then they began to play , chasing one another and rolling in dirt and leaves , yipping in excitement . I saw them dance with joy , a joy inspired by pups no different from us . I nudged Triell 's cheek . // " There 's nothing to be afraid of , " I said to him . " You just have to show that you 're strong and respectful . " Triell 's tail wagged gently as he watched the pup welcoming . I looked at his lively eyes and small , strong neck and knew we were just as healthy and worthy as Ruuqo and Rissa 's pups . My mother had worried for nothing . Soon it would be our turn to win Ruuqo 's approval . Our turn to be given our names , and granted our places in the Swift River pack . // Ruuqo lowered his eyes as he approached us . He was the largest wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an ear than any other Swift River wolf . The muscles under his gray fur moved commandingly as he left his own pups with the rest of the pack and stalked over to where we stood . He hesitated . Then he bent over us and opened his great jaws . Our mother stepped in front of us , blocking him . // " Brother , " she begged , for she and Rissa had been littermates , and had joined the Swift River pack together , " you must let them live . " // " They bear the blood of Outsiders , Neesa . They will take meat from my children . The pack can not support extra pups . " His voice was so cold and angry that I began to tremble . Next to me I heard Triell whimper. // " That 's a lie , " our mother said as she raised her head to look up at him , amber eyes unwavering . She was much smaller than Ruuqo . " We 've managed before when prey was scarce . You 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coward to lead the Swift River pack . Only a coward kills pups. " // Ruuqo growled and slammed into her , pinning her to the ground . // " You think I like killing pups ? " he demanded . " With pups of my own standing not two wolflengths away ? Your pups are not just ' something different . ' They smell of Outsider blood . I did not bring them into this world , Neesa . I did not break the covenant . That is your responsibility . " He took her neck in his teeth and bit down until she yelped , then he stepped off her . // Mother scrambled to her feet when Ruuqo released her , and backed away from him , leaving us to face his deadly jaws . We all ran back and clustered around her . " But they are named ! " she said . // My mother had given us names at birth , in defiance of wolf custom . " If you have names , " she told us , " you are pack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my three sisters after the plants surrounding our den , and named my brother Triell for the dark of a moonless night . He was the only black wolf in her litter and his eyes shone like stars from his dark face . She named me Kaala , daughter of the Moon , because of the white crescent on the gray fur of my chest . // Triell and I stood trembling beside our mother . My sisters cringed on her other side . We had believed our mother when she told us we could find our places in the pack . I had laughed at her worries . We believed we needed only to act like wolves worthy of pack to be accepted . Now we understood that we might not even be granted a chance at life . // " They are named , brother , " she said again . // " Not by me , " Ruuqo said . " They are not legitimate and they are not pack . Stand aside . " // " I will not , " she said . // A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarred along her face and muzzle , leapt upon my mother , forcing her aside . Ruuqo joined the large female , forcing our mother away from us. // " Pup killer ! You are not my brother , " she snarled at him . " You 're not fit to be wolf . " // Even I could tell my mother 's words hurt Ruuqo , and he growled and chased her back to the mouth of our den , leaving us alone on a rise on the warm side of the clearing . The large female guarded her . Then Ruuqo turned to us . Rissa stepped forward , leaving her pups crying and trying to follow behind her . She stood beside Ruuqo. // " Lifemate , " she said , " this duty is as much mine as yours . I should have kept closer watch on my sister . I will do what must be done . " Her voice was deep and rich and her white fur shone in the early light . She smelled of strength and confidence . // Ruuqo licked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if gathering courage from her . Then he shouldered her gently aside , moving her away from us . The rest of the pack stood around the clearing , some of them whining , some merely watching , all keeping a distance from Ruuqo , who now stood towering above us . Even now , I sometimes look at him and see him standing over me , ready to grab me by the neck and shake me until I stopped moving . That is what he did to all three of my sisters and then to Triell , my brother , my favorite . // Azzuen says I ca n't possibly remember what really happened that day since I was only four weeks old , but I do . I remember . Ruuqo took my sisters , one by one , in his jaws and shook the life out of them . Then he picked up Triell . My brother was lying beside me , pressed up against me , and then he was not . The warmth of his flesh and fur was suddenly gone from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the ground . Triell 's eyes held mine and , forgetting my terror , I struggled to stand on my back legs to reach him . My weakness betrayed me and I fell to the ground as Ruuqo 's sharp teeth closed on Triell 's small , soft body . He grasped my brother in those teeth and crushed his small form , until the bright light of Triell 's eyes flickered out , and his body sagged and then was still . I could n't believe he was dead , that he would n't lift his head again to look at me . Ruuqo dropped him beside the limp bodies of my sisters . And then he turned to me . My mother had crept back from the mouth of the den . Now she crawled forward on her belly , her ears flat against her head and her tail invisible beneath her , begging Ruuqo to stop . He ignored her . // " He does what he must do , Neesa , " an old , gentle wolf said to her . " The pups bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do to protect his pack . You should n't make it harder for him . " // I stood , looking up at Ruuqo 's massive height . Cringing and pleading had done my brother and sisters no good . When Triell 's body left Ruuqo 's jaws and landed on the earth with the softest of thumps , my trembling turned to fury . Triell and I had slept and fed as one . Together we had dreamed of winning our places in the pack . Now he was dead . I bared my teeth and copied the growl I 'd heard in Ruuqo 's voice . Ruuqo was so startled he stepped back and shook himself before coming for me again . Anger swept away my fear , and I leapt for his throat . My weak legs took me only to his chest , and he easily cast me aside . But Ruuqo looked as though he 'd stared the Deathwolf himself in the face . He stood still , watching me for a long moment as I snarled with as much fury as I could summon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said softly , " but , you see , I must do what 's right for the pack . I must do my duty , " and he bent his head and opened his jaws to crush me . The other wolves of the pack cried out in distress , trembling and pressing against one another . Dawn was turning to day , and the bright light of the morning stung my eyes as I looked up at my death . // " I think this one wants to live , Ruuqo. " // Ruuqo froze , his jaws still open , his pale yellow eyes wide and startled . Then , to my amazement , his deadly jaws closed , and he raised his head , flattened his ears , and stepped back to greet the newcomer . // When I followed his gaze , I saw a wolf larger than any wolf could be . His chest was level with Ruuqo 's muzzle , and his neck , which seemed to me to be nearly as high up as the beams of sunlight now filtering into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with amusement . He had strange green eyes , unlike the amber eyes of the adult wolves of my pack , or the blue eyes of the pups . After a moment , another huge wolf with the same green eyes and a darker , shaggier coat stalked up to stand beside him . // All the wolves in my mother 's pack hurried from the edges of the clearing to greet these strange and frightening creatures . They approached respectfully , lowering ears and tails , and dropping to their bellies to offer the larger wolves the greatest respect . // " They are the Greatwolves , " my mother whispered . She had crept close to me when the large wolves entered our clearing . " Jandru and Frandra . Two of the only ones left in the Wide Valley . They speak directly to the Ancients , and we all answer to them . " // The Greatwolves graciously accepted the greetings of the smaller wolves . // " Lordwolves , welcome . " Ruuqo spoke respectfully with his head down . " I do what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must care for my pack . " // " Second litters often are allowed to live . " Jandru bent his head to nuzzle Triell 's still form . " As you well know , Ruuqo . It was only four years ago that you and your littermates were spared . A long time for you , perhaps , but not for me. " // " That was a time of plenty , Lordwolf. " // " One pup does not eat so very much . I would have her live . " // Ruuqo did not speak for a moment , unwilling to risk Jandru 's anger . // " There is more , Lordwolf , " Rissa said , stepping forward . " The pup is of Outsider blood . We can not break the rules of the valley . " // " Of Outsider blood ? " There was no longer any trace of laughter in Jandru 's voice . He glared at Ruuqo . " Why did n't you tell me that ? " // Ruuqo lowered his head even farther . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of my pack . " // Jandru watched him a long time without speaking and then turned to my mother , speaking to her in real anger . " What were you thinking , risking the safety of your pack ? " // Frandra , the female Greatwolf , spoke for the first time . She stood even taller than her mate , and her voice was strong and sure . Her eyes shone from her dark fur . She spoke so loudly and startled me so much that I leapt back , falling on my backside . // " Easy for you to say , Jandru , when you can breed wherever and whenever you please without consequence . She did not conceive alone . " Jandru looked abashed and lowered his ears just the slightest bit . Frandra watched him for a moment and turned her great head to my mother . " But why did you allow them to live long enough to call themselves wolf ? You must have known they could not live . You should have killed them when you bore them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought they would be important . " My mother 's voice was soft and frightened . " I dreamed they would save wolfkind . In some dreams , they stopped the prey from leaving the valley . In other dreams , they drove the humans away . Always they saved us . See how fearless she is ? " // I stood again , and tried to still the trembling in my legs , to look like a wolf worthy of pack . // " Lordwolves , my sister has always wished to have a greater role in the pack , " Rissa said . " Sometimes her dreams have led us to good hunting , but she 's always wanted pups. " // " It does n't matter , " Jandru said abruptly . " The pup 's of Outsider blood and can not live . Do what you must , Ruuqo. " // Jandru turned away , almost stepping on me , so I growled at him , too . " I am sorry , Smallteeth , " he said . " I would save you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to the Wide Valley again . " // I felt the unfairness of it like the cold , damp wind that seeped sometimes into my mother 's den . How could a creature be so great and not be able to do what he wished ? I began to look again around the clearing , searching for a place to hide . I turned to run . Frandra stepped over me , placing her own body between me and Ruuqo 's sharp teeth . // She growled . // " I will not let you kill this pup , " she said . " So what if it is not what we usually do ! Things are changing , Lifemate , and we must change with them . The humans are taking more prey than ever before , and each day they grow more out of control . The Balance has already been upset and we can wait no longer to take action . We must change and change now . " The Greatwolf looked down at me . " If she 's of the blood , so be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it may also be our hope . The will to live is too strong to ignore . We must listen to the messages the Ancients send to us. " // " Frandra , " Jandru began . // " Have you lost use of your nose and ears , Jandru ? " she snapped . " You know we are almost out of time . And we are failing . " // " I wo n't take the risk , " he said . " We did not give permission for this exception and we can not go against the Greatwolf council . That is my decision . " // " The decision is not yours alone . " Frandra met his eyes steadily . " Do you want to fight me ? Come , fight me if you will . " // Jandru stood still as death for the briefest moment . Frandra spoke again . // " Look at her chest , Lifemate , " she whispered softly , urgently , so that only Jandru , my mother , and I could hear her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Balance . The council is rigid , and they do not always see what is before them . What if she is the one ? Maybe the Ancients have chosen this one for us. " // " I have named her Kaala , daughter of the Moon , " my mother said . // Jandru looked at me a long time . He flipped me over onto my back to better see the moon shape on my chest . As he held me there with a paw nearly as big as my body , I tried to think of something , anything , I could do to convince him I deserved to live . But I could only stare into his strange eyes as he decided my fate . Finally , he stepped away from me and bowed to Frandra. // " Give her the chance , " he said to Ruuqo . " If it 's a mistake , the Greatwolves will bear the burden . " // " But Lordwolves , " Ruuqo began . // " You are not to kill this pup , smallwolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the rules of the valley , and we may grant exceptions as we so choose . We have good reason for sparing this pup. " // When Ruuqo tried to speak again , the Greatwolf growled and , placing both her front legs on his back , forced him to the ground . When she released him , he scrambled to his feet and bent his head in submission , but resentment burned in his eyes . Frandra ignored his anger . // " Good fortune , Kaala Smallteeth . " Frandra opened her great jaws in a smile as she shouldered Jandru aside and trotted into the woods . " I will certainly see you again . " Jandru followed behind her . // As the Greatwolves left the clearing , my mother whispered urgently to me . " Listen , Kaala . Listen carefully . Ruuqo will not let me stay with the pack . I am certain of it . But you must stay , and you must live . You must do whatever you have to do to survive , and become part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pack you must come find me . There are things you must know about your father and about me . Do you promise me that ? " // Her eyes held mine and I could n't refuse her . // " I promise , " I whispered . " But I want to go with you . " // " No , " she said . She pressed the soft fur of her muzzle to my face . I inhaled her scent . " You must stay and become part of the pack . Do not come for me until then . You have promised . " // I wanted to ask her why . I wanted to ask her how I would find her , but I did n't get the chance . As soon as the Greatwolves were out of hearing range , Ruuqo turned on my mother and bit her savagely on the neck , drawing blood and making her yelp . He knocked her to the ground and as she fell , she shoved me out of the way with her hip . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my feet . // " You have brought chaos to your pack , my children , and me , " Ruuqo snarled , " and forced the Swift River pack into conflict with the Balance . " // Wolves do not normally hurt each other when they fight , since most wolves know their place in the pack and avoid conflict . But Ruuqo could not take out his frustration on me , and he certainly could not fight the Greatwolves . So he turned instead on my mother . She tried to fight back , but when Minn , a yearling male , and Werrna , the big , scar-faced female , attacked her , too , she whimpered and scrambled to the edge of the clearing . When she tried to come back to the rest of the pack , they attacked again , driving her away . I wanted to run back to my mother , to help her , but my courage had deserted me and I could only watch in terror . // Rissa took the closest pup , Reel , in her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me stay long enough to wean her , brother , " my mother said desperately . " Then I will leave . " // " You 'll leave now , " he said . " You are no longer pack . " He chased her to the edge of the clearing and each time she tried to come back , he and the other two wolves attacked her again . At last , bleeding and whimpering , she darted into the forest , her three attackers chasing her away . // When he returned , Ruuqo gave a commanding bark , and he and all the rest of the adult wolves except Rissa quit the clearing . They had only a few hours before the hot sun would make hunting impossible and Ruuqo had a pack to feed . // I wanted to follow my mother into the woods , but I was exhausted in body and soul and sank to the hard ground , cold even in the warmth of the morning sun . // Two of Rissa 's largest pups , the ones named Unnan and Borlla , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Borlla , the bigger of the two , poked me painfully in the ribs with her muzzle . // " Does n't look like it 'll live long , " she said to Unnan. // " Looks like bear food to me , " he said . // " Hey , Bear Food , " Borlla said . " Better stay away from our milk . " // " Or we 'll finish what Ruuqo started . " Unnan 's mean little eyes swept over me. // The two pups trotted toward the entrance of the den into which Rissa had disappeared earlier . On their way , Borlla swatted the smallest pup of the litter , the raggedy male who had not been given a name , and Unnan growled at Marra , another smallpup , and tumbled her into the dirt . Satisfied , they lifted their tails high and strutted into the den . After a moment Marra got up and followed , but the smallest pup stayed crouched where he had fallen . // I stayed alone in the clearing , waiting for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot and oppressive . I thought if I just waited long enough she would return for me , take me with her in her exile . // My mother did not return for the rest of the long day , or into the night , though I waited until the pack returned for their afternoon slumber and left again for the evening hunt , until the terrifying sounds of unknown creatures made me fear for my life once again . Still she did not come back . I was alive , but I was alone , frightened , and despised by the pack that was supposed to care for me. // I would not return to my mother 's den , for it smelled of my dead littermates and meant only loneliness . But I did smell milk and warm bodies , and heard the unmistakable sounds of suckling . Hunger pierced the numbness that kept me huddled in the dirt . A part of me wondered how I could think about food when my mother was gone forever , but I could n't see the point of standing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rissa 's warm milk . I did n't know if she would feed me , but I was her sister 's pup and shared her blood . I had to try . I had n't forgotten Borlla 's and Unnan 's threats , but the pull of hunger was stronger than my fear . I turned my back on the bodies of my littermates and crept toward the good smells and sounds coming from Rissa 's den . I stopped when I saw the raggedy pup hunched miserably at the edge of the den . // " You 'll starve if you just stay out here . " He looked up at me when I spoke , but did n't answer . He had a cut over his right eye where Borlla had swatted him , and his matted dark gray coat made him look even smaller than he was . But he had bright , silvery eyes . It was those unusual eyes , so like Triell 's , that stopped me and kept me from ignoring him on my way to my meal . // " Littlewolf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , " if you let them bully you , you 'll always be a curl-tail . " Most packs have a curl-tail , a wolf who is picked on , one who does n't get as much to eat and is kept at the fringes of the pack . But I did n't think the smallpup would even live to be a curl-tail if he did n't get some food and the safety of the den soon . // He wrapped his scraggly tail around his legs and looked back down at the equally scraggly grass growing in the dirt . His scowl hid his brilliant eyes . " That 's easy for you to say , with the Greatwolves on your side . They all want me to die . That 's why they did n't give me a name . " // Impatient , I turned from him . I did n't have time for a pup who did n't even want to live . My brother , Triell , would 've given anything to have this chance at life . He would n't have whined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no place for such a wolf . I poked my nose in the den and Rissa spoke . // " Come , pups , " she said . " Come drink and rest . " // My heart lifted and I began to climb into the den . And then I stopped and looked again at the smallpup . The memory of being alone and unwanted nagged at me . I could n't leave him to starve . I backed out of the den and , without wasting any more words , shoved him from behind , toppling him into the den . He rolled forward with a surprised yelp and I crawled in after him . // Rissa 's den was larger than my mother 's had been , its solid dirt walls held steady by the roots of the great oak that dominated the den site , but was still small enough to feel safe . The four pups fed hungrily at Rissa 's belly . As the smallpup and I crept closer , Unnan rolled one eye toward us and growled . The smallpup standing next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartsore from the loss of my littermates and my mother , and angry at the way the entire pack had treated me . My body grew hot and tight and I felt the fur on my back rising up and when I saw Unnan and fat Borlla feeding so contentedly , keeping everything for their greedy selves , I shoved Unnan away , making room for myself and the smallpup . I did n't stop to think about the consequences of making an enemy of Unnan . I was just mad . When the smallpup hesitated , I grabbed the soft fur at the top of his neck and dragged him to a feeding place . // " Eat , " I told him . // Unnan harried me as I tried to feed , and Borlla growled , but I ignored them , reaching for Rissa 's rich , life-giving milk . The smallpup nestled between me and Marra , the kindest of Rissa 's pups . Full and warm , we all fell asleep against Rissa 's strong body . // The next morning Unnan and Borlla tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary of her long confinement , left us with the pack 's two yearling wolves and bounded off beside Ruuqo to join the predawn hunt . Yearling wolves are often pupwatchers when adults are away . Minn , who had helped chase my mother away , was a bully and not particularly interested in watching us , but he was afraid of his sister , Yllin , and she took her responsibility seriously . They played roughly with us , and I loved how they growled and pretended to fight us . When they tired of allowing us to pounce on them and bite their tails , they watched us from a shady spot as we continued to wrestle with one another . When they slipped into their naps , I played with Marra and the smallpup . He was almost as small as I , even though he was two full weeks older , and he did not have the physical strength of a survivor wolf . But I looked more closely at his sparkling eyes and saw that he no longer had the hopeless , weary look that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even with too little food in his belly , and in spite of the harassment of Borlla and Unnan . Surprised and pleased by this change in him , I pounced on him and he yipped joyfully as we rolled in the dirt . // Because he was dark-coated as Triell had been , and not much bigger than my lost brother , I felt I had known the smallpup for longer than a day . Amidst our scuffling , I nosed him gently on the cheek . Delighted , he poked his cold nose into my face hard enough to knock me over . I landed with an undignified thump , sending up a cloud of dust . At first he looked startled and apologetic , but then he pounced on top of me , and we wrestled happily . With a yip , Marra joined the game . The three other pups ignored us at first . Borlla was fat , pale-coated , and smelled of the milk she took first of all of us . Her fur was not the bright , pure white of Rissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unnan was a dirty gray-brown and had a thin muzzle and tiny eyes that made him look more weasel than wolf . Reel , though larger than Marra and the smallpup , was smaller than Borlla and Unnan , and he struggled to keep up with the big pups as they fought each other in a rougher game . I played and wrestled with Marra and the smallpup until finally , too tired to continue , I sat to rest by a prickly berry bush as Marra chased the smallpup under the oak tree . I closed my eyes , lulled by the rising sun and the happy exhaustion of playing with the other pups. // Moments before my assailants attacked , I heard them and leapt to my feet . Unnan , Reel , and Borlla all pounced on me at once , knocking me flat on my back . I was unprepared for the attack and they quickly pinned me down and began to bite . To Yllin and Minn , watching sleepily from the shade , it might have looked like play . But the pups were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to crush the air from my chest . // " Ruuqo was too weak to finish killing you , but we 'll finish , " Unnan growled . // " There 's no room for you in our pack , " Borlla whispered as she tried to bite through my neck . // Reel was silent as he tried to rip at my belly . // I growled and bit and snarled and fought against them as best I could , but there were three of them and only one of me , and I knew that even if they did not kill me they could injure me severely enough to make me too weak to survive . // Just as my strength was giving out , something knocked Unnan and Borlla off me . I bit Reel on the shoulder and scrambled to my feet . The smallpup had come to my aid and had so surprised his two littermates that they had fallen awkwardly onto the hard ground . Now Unnan had him pressed to the ground as Borlla prepared to rip at his throat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the smallpup and biting into his ugly fur . He tasted like dirt . Borlla abandoned her attack on the smallpup and came to help Unnan . Together they pinned me to the ground . // " Your father was a hyena , " Borlla sneered , standing over me , " and your mother a traitor and a weakling . " // " That 's why she left you , " Unnan added , baring his teeth . // Both pups growled and snarled , expecting me to be afraid of their larger size and greater strength . But I had been angry already when they ganged up on the smallpup . Their insults about my mother only made me angrier now . // How dare they ? A voice in my head was so loud I could not hear the sounds of the clearing . The stench of blood in my nose blocked all the scents of oak and spruce and wolf . Kill them . They are not fit to be wolf . For the second time , fury took me like the wind takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have killed them both , I know I would , but Reel had the smallpup trapped and I had to help him . When I tumbled Reel off him , the smallpup stood beside me , and together we faced the three of them , snarling . I heard Marra running to get help from the pupwatchers . I smelled hatred in Unnan and Borlla , and fear in Reel . I saw the smallpup looking at me out of the corner of his eye , with something like awe on his face . My back left leg bled from a deep gash I had not noticed in the fight , and I felt it weakening beneath me . The smallpup held his right forepaw up as if it hurt him . // I looked over the heads of our adversaries to see Yllin racing back across the clearing followed by an angry Ruuqo . The other pups followed my gaze and Borlla , Unnan , and Reel spun around to face Ruuqo , dropping to their bellies . The pack had returned early from an unsuccessful hunt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " I 'm sorry , leaderwolf , " she said , ears low . " They were playing , and then the big pups attacked . The smallpups fought only to defend themselves . " She paused , and dared to speak again , which I thought was very brave , since Ruuqo might be angry at her for letting the fight get out of hand . " They fought well . " // Ruuqo raised his ears at her but did not discipline her . I could tell he liked Yllin . He let her get away with more than another young wolf might . His eyes swept over us. // " No wolf deeply injures or kills a packmate without cause , " he said . " If you can not learn that , you can not be pack . All Swift River wolves know the difference between challenge fights and a fight to kill . " He turned to a cowering Reel . " What is the difference , pup ? " // Reel looked around at Borlla and Unnan for assistance and Ruuqo swatted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked you . Well ? " // Reel said nothing , just rolled over on his back and whined . // " Yllin , " Ruuqo said , " please explain the difference . " // Yllin 's ears and tail lifted . " Challenge fighting is the fighting a wolf must do to win his or her place in the pack , or the fighting a leaderwolf must do to discipline pack members , to keep order . And you hurt your opponent only as much as you must , " she said . " In a fight to kill , you are trying to hurt or kill your opponent . You only fight to kill when you have no other choice . " // Ruuqo whuffed in approval . " All wolves must know how to fight or they will have no place in the pack , " he continued . " But only leaderwolves may kill or tell others to kill a pack member . And we of the Swift River pack will not kill another wolf unless we are being threatened by a rival pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruuqo struck Borlla when she tried to rise . Unnan and Reel had more sense and stayed low . Then he turned to the smallpup and me . We lowered ourselves to the ground and awaited his blow . He nosed the smallpup gently . He did not even look at me. // " There is more to being wolf , " he said , " than the strength to win a fight , or the speed to catch prey . " He spoke loudly enough for the whole pack to hear , but his words were clearly directed to the pups he had disciplined . " Size and strength and speed are all part of what makes a wolf worthy of pack . But courage and honor are just as important . The interests of the pack come first , and every wolf must serve the pack . " He spoke directly to Borlla , Unnan , and Reel . " Wolves who can not learn that are not welcome in the Swift River pack . " // I know it was n't kind , but I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borlla and Reel , and especially of Unnan , who had lowered himself so far to the ground I thought he might disappear into the earth . But what Ruuqo did next surprised me . Usually , when a pup is not given a name , he waits as long as three moons to be accepted into the pack and then is almost certain to be low ranking . Ruuqo turned to the smallpup , and spoke softly . // " You have shown courage , honor , and strength of spirit , all qualities of a true wolf . And I welcome you into the Swift River pack . " He took the smallpup 's muzzle in his jaws . // Rissa eagerly stepped forward , tail high , her white fur shining in the sun , and spoke before Ruuqo could continue . // " We name you Azzuen , a warrior 's name , the name of my father , " she said . " Carry your name well and do honor to the Swift River pack . " // And just like that , the smallpup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't untangle my happiness for him from my jealousy -- my mother had given me a name , but no one would call me by it . I had fought more fiercely than Azzuen , but Ruuqo had snubbed me , would not acknowledge my courage . For just a moment , I 'm ashamed to say , I wanted to take Azzuen by his neck fur and shake him . But as he walked back to the den , his little tail whipped proudly back and forth so temptingly I could n't resist it . I felt the meanness in me dry up and I snuck up behind him , leapt , and playfully nipped his tail . He turned in surprise , and I grinned at him and ran into Rissa 's den . With a bark louder than should have come from so small a pup , he leapt after me , into the milk-smelling earth . I could never bring Triell back , but in Azzuen I had once again found a brother . // Ruuqo would not defy the Greatwolves and kill me outright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it easy for me to survive . The first time we pups fed outside the den , he stood glowering in front of Rissa , stepping aside to let the other pups pass by to reach their food , but growling and snarling when I tried to do so . It took all of my courage to wriggle past him to get my meal . Every time he saw me , he growled . Though they dared not try to kill me again , Unnan and Borlla followed Ruuqo 's lead , attacking me whenever they got the chance . // Three nights after the Greatwolves intervened to save my life , Ruuqo howled to assemble the pack , to tell them to prepare to journey the next morning . // " Ruuqo ! " Rissa raised her head angrily from where she rested by the den . " None of the pups are old enough for the journey . " // " What journey ? " Reel asked Borlla. // " The journey to our summer home , " answered Yllin , the young female who had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us by the large oak that shaded the den site . // " It 's our best gathering place , where you can be safe while we hunt and bring back food for you . The den site is too small and too warm to stay in all summer . " // " Is it far ? " I asked . // " For a pup , it 's far . Most packs have summer gathering places near their den sites , but our old den site was flooded last winter so we must travel farther . " She frowned . " Last year Ruuqo waited until we were eight weeks old to move us . I ca n't imagine what he 's thinking . " // Rissa narrowed her eyes , watching Ruuqo as he paced the clearing . // " You want to get back at the Greatwolves , " she accused . " You want the pup to die . " None of us had to ask which pup she meant . She rose and walked to him , placing her nose to his cheek . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not defy Jandru and Frandra. " // " No , " he said , " I can not . But I can not anger the Ancients , either . You know the wolves of the Wide Valley must keep their blood pure , or risk the consequences . If we allow her to live , the Ancients could send drought , or a freeze that kills all the prey , or a plague . It 's happened before . The legends tell us so . " He shook his head in frustration . " And where will Frandra and Jandru be if the other Greatwolves see her and do not like what she is ? Or other packs in the valley ? Greatwolves do not live with the same consequences we do , and yet they can force us to take action that could be our ruin . I wo n't let my pack suffer . " // Werrna , the scarred female who was Ruuqo and Rissa 's secondwolf , spoke up . " The Stone Peak wolves killed the Wet Woods pack -- while a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live . And it 's not as if we can hide it , " she said , looking at me . " She bears the mark of the unlucky . She could bring death to our pack . " // Rissa ignored Werrna . " Then we will carry the smaller pups , if they can not make it across the plain . " // " No pup is carried . Any pup that can not make the journey is not fit to be a Swift River wolf , " Ruuqo replied . " If the Wolf of the Moon means her to live , so be it . But I will allow only strong wolves in my pack . " // " I will not let you endanger my pups for your pride ! " Rissa snapped . // " It is not my pride , Rissa , it is our survival . And we journey when the sun rises . " Ruuqo almost never used his leader voice with Rissa , almost never bullied her . But when he did he made it clear that he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , and weak from giving milk to us pups . If she challenged him , she would lose . // His voice softened . " We have known since we were young that we must honor the covenant , Rissa . And we have both made sacrifices to it before . " I had not heard sadness in his voice before , and wondered what caused it . // Rissa stared at him for a long time and then stalked away . His ears and tail drooping , Ruuqo watched her go . // Early the next morning , the pack set out . Rissa refused to take part in the leave-taking ceremony and stood aloof as the rest of the pack gathered around Ruuqo , each touching him and crying out for a good journey . I watched , fascinated , as the adult wolves wove around Ruuqo , touching their noses to his face and neck . He in turn placed his head on shoulders and necks , and licked outstretched faces . // " Wo n't you join us , Rissa ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Good planning means a good journey , " she snapped . " I will not celebrate this leave-taking . " // Ruuqo said no more to her , but lifted his voice in a great howl . One by one the other wolves joined him , singing to the sky . And the journey began . // We walked away from the den site and the old oak , and scrambled up the rise that protected the den . Our clearing was at the very edge of a small stand of trees that sheltered us , and beyond the trees stretched a vast plain . It sloped gently uphill , and I could not see the end of it . // I remember little of the first part of that journey . At four weeks old , I was only two weeks younger than Rissa 's pups , but it made a difference . My legs were that much shorter , my lungs that much weaker , my eyes just a little less able to focus . The wound in my leg had not yet healed and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see that Azzuen 's front paw was still hurting him , too . We were all terrified of being left behind , and did not even try to sort out the new sounds and smells . But Azzuen , Marra , and I were the smallest and it was harder for us than for the other pups . Soon we fell behind the others . After we walked for what seemed like hours , we saw the wolves ahead of us stop in the shade of a large boulder . We hurried to catch up , and collapsed in a heap of fatigue . Even Borlla and Unnan were panting with effort and were too tired to harass me . We were allowed to rest for only a few moments before the adult wolves pushed and prodded us to our feet and we began the journey again . I had less time to rest than the others since I had reached the boulder last of all , and my legs shook as I stood . As we reached the crest of the long slope , we could see across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Rissa gave a great howl . " Your new home lies on the other side , pups . Once you make it to the woods and to Fallen Tree Gathering Place , you will be safe . You will have passed your first test as wolf . " // The rest of the pack joined her in the howl . " Keep to the journey . Call on your strength . " // We walked forever across that great plain , cringing against the openness of the sky . We were so used to trees above us , and the sights and sounds of this great flat land overwhelmed us . After what seemed like a lifetime of walking , I looked up at the sun overhead to see the day half over , and I could not believe we would reach the other side before dark . Ruuqo and Rissa led the way , with the rest of the pack following , the adult wolves surrounding the pups . Rissa , the yearling wolves , and the oldwolf , Trevegg , kept coming back to check on stragglers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marra , two weeks older than I and better fed than Azzuen , managed to keep up , but soon the gap between the core pack and the stragglers grew , leaving Azzuen and me behind . // Ruuqo barked for the adults with us to catch up . Trevegg turned back to me and lifted me gently in his jaws . From far ahead , Ruuqo gave another sharp bark . // " Every pup must walk the journey . They will arrive on their own feet , or they are not fit to be wolf . " // Trevegg hesitated , but put me gently down . // " Keep walking , littlewolf . If you do not give up , you will find us . Keep the strength . You are part of the Balance . " // When Trevegg set me down , I could not lift myself up again , but sat in despair as the rest of the pack moved away . Azzuen sat beside me , whimpering. // Then Yllin , the strong-minded yearling female , broke away from the pack again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between me and the rest of the pack in a matter of moments and I despaired of my tired legs ever being strong enough to carry me far enough and quickly enough . Yllin had a sharp tongue and little patience for weakness and I was certain she had come to mock me . But when she stopped , ignoring Ruuqo 's angry warning , there was mischief in her amber eyes . // " Come , little sister , " she said . " I plan to be leaderwolf of Swift River someday , and will need a secondwolf . Do not disappoint me . " She bent to speak so softly only I could hear . // " It 's the way of the wolf . This is the first of three tests you must pass . If you pass all three -- the crossing , the first hunt , and the first winter -- Ruuqo has to give you romma , the mark of pack acceptance , and every wolf you meet will know you are a Swift River wolf and that you are worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help a weaker pup through the tests . All of us love pups and want them to live . We 'd sooner give up hunting and live on grass than hurt a pup . But if leaderwolves want to test a pup 's strength they may challenge her . If a pup is strong enough to survive such trials , she is strong enough to be pack . If not , there 's more food for the others . " // Then , before Ruuqo could come back for her and punish her for her defiance , Yllin pelted back to join the rest of the pack , tail low , and I could see her asking Ruuqo 's pardon . // The pack moved farther and farther away , until I could barely see their dark shapes on the open plain . But Trevegg 's kindness and Yllin 's cheerful defiance heartened me , and I got to my feet and began to take one painful step after another . Azzuen followed . But after an hour , my breath came in gasps and I no longer looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack was . The gash in my leg began bleeding again and burned with every step . Azzuen began to fall behind me and I slowed my pace even more , allowing him to catch up . // We walked . We walked until my paws felt bruised and each breath took so much effort I wished again and again I did not need the air . I could no longer see my pack and their scent grew fainter and fainter until I could no longer trust the trail I followed . // The sky darkened . // Grown wolves travel at night , avoiding the heat of day , but a pup is prey and any pack that values its pups does not take them out in the open after dark until they are old enough to fend for themselves . // " Bear food , " Unnan had whispered to me before we left that morning . I was listening to Ruuqo and Rissa argue about the journey and had not heard him come up behind me. // " You 'll be bear food before tomorrow morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her cubs . " // I had stalked away from him with as much dignity as I could scrape up , but now as Azzuen and I stood alone out in the open , Unnan 's words haunted me. // And yet we kept walking . I was angry and hurt that the pack did not care if I lived or died , but I had nowhere else to go and they were the only family I had . So I walked on until my legs gave out beneath me and my tired nose could no longer distinguish the scent of my pack from the other scents on the plain . As a cloudy dusk crept over the sky , I sank down on the ground and waited for death to come . Azzuen crumpled beside me. // Sleep came , and dreams . Dreams of bears and sharp teeth . But as I fell deeper into sleep , I saw a face , the kindly face of a young shewolf . She was no wolf I knew , for only my pack was familiar to me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like me , she had a white moon shape on her chest , like no other wolf in the pack had . I wondered if she might be a vision of my mother from a younger , happier time . // The dreamwolf laughed . " No , little Smallteeth , though I am one of your many mothers from a time longer ago than you can imagine . " I felt a warmth suffusing me , easing the aches in my body . " You are not meant to die today , sisterwolf . You promised your mother you would survive and become pack . You must live and carry on my work . You have much to do .

" // " They gave me a name and they still do n't care if I live or die , " he whispered miserably . " They just left me here . " // Impatience with Azzuen 's self-pity rose in me and I bit him again , much harder this time . // " Stop feeling sorry for yourself , " I said , ignoring his yelp of pain .

I 'll go where you go , Kaala . " He looked at me with simple trust as if I were a grown wolf , and his belief in me gave me strength . Azzuen trusted me to get him home , and so I would . // The pain in my feet and in my chest seemed distant from me , and the dreamwolf 's scent guided me as the pack-scent had before . I did not even know if it would lead me where my pack had gone , but I could no longer distinguish the scents of my family , so I followed it . I looked up and saw the great light of the moon , completely round and so bright that my way was not dark . It did not give warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I walked with determination . I could see , out of the corner of my eye , the shape of the young dreamwolf guiding me on . If I tried to look directly at her , she disappeared , and I got the sense that she was laughing at me . When my legs tired , I would remember Azzuen plodding trustfully beside me and keep on going . // And , then , when I thought I could walk no more , the night became darker and the ground beneath my paws cooler . Trees rose above my head , dimming the light of the moon . I had crossed the great plain . The dreamwolf faded with the moonlight and everything in my body hurt . Being alone in the forest did n't seem much better than being alone on the plain , and my weary nose could not pick up the scent of my pack . At last I caught a familiar scent . // " I waited for you . " Yllin stood tall at the edge of the wood . " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And welcome to you , smallpup . " She grinned at Azzuen . I was too tired to do anything but gratefully touch my nose to her lowered muzzle . We found the pack-scent and walked the last hour to the gathering place and fell into a heap of exhaustion . // Ruuqo did n't even greet us . He just looked over at Rissa , who gazed at him with a challenge in her eyes . // " She can stay , " he said , " until her winter coat comes in . But I make no promises that I will make her pack . " // I did n't know what he meant , but Yllin had spoken of something similar . I did n't have the energy left to figure it out . And after a moment I did n't care , for Rissa , and then the rest of the pack , came to me and licked me in greeting , and called me by my name . //

Even worse , what happens when they escape ? // " Worms ! You 're going to raise worms in the garage ? " " Yes , Maddie . " Mom nods and asks me to pass the Parmesan cheese . " Cool , " says my 6-year-old brother , Avery , his face smeared with spaghetti sauce . " Cool " is not the word I would use . Some people have a fear of flying or freak out at the sight of blood . With me , seeing even a single worm makes me ... well , imagine being in the path of an oncoming train . That 's the feeling I get when I see a worm . Total panic . I blame Billy Peppercorn . In kindergarten , he told me to hold out my hands and close my eyes . I knew Billy liked me . So I did as he said , expecting something truly wonderful . Into my hands he plopped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been keeping for months in a dirt-filled jar . I screamed and threw Buddy high in the air . Where he landed nobody knows , though Billy spent an hour crying and looking for him . In the end , Billy decided to find someone else to like , and I ended up with a severe worm phobia . Which is a shame because Billy Peppercorn is now in my fifth-grade class , and he turned out really cute . My worm phobia is a secret . You know how kids and brothers are . Once they find out your weakness , you 're done for . So I 'm not about to mention it now . I look over at Dad , hoping he 'll do something , but he just calmly takes a bite of garlic bread .

" Worm poop , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about worm poop at the dinner table . " Will there be enough room in the garage for my car ? " my brother Carter asks . Carter is 16 , and his car is rusty and dented , but it 's his prize possession . Sort of like Buddy was to Billy Peppercorn . " The bin wo n't take up much space . Your car will be fine , " Mom says . I stare at my spaghetti noodles tinged pink with tomato sauce . They look like worms . I feel sick . The worms arrived three days ago-all 1,500 of them . Who knew you could order earthworms online and have them delivered right to your door ? When Mom opened the box , she held up a few , cooed to them , and called them beauties . Beauties ? My heart jumped out of my chest and fled the room . I quickly followed . , For several days , the worm-filled box stayed in the living room while Mom prepared their new home . I about died . But Mom explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , she had to make bedding by combining newspaper , soil , manure , and peat moss . Then , she had to wait a few days to make sure the bacteria present did n't heat things up too much . Temperatures above 85 degrees can kill worms . We do n't have a dog or a cat , but , by the way Mom 's been fussing and worrying over the worms , you 'd think they were our pets ! Weird . Right now , she is all excited and fluttering around the breakfast table because we 'll be using the composting bin for the first time . The entire family marches out to the garage . The composting bin consists of a wooden frame with a hinged mesh lid . There are tiny holes drilled in the bottom and sides for drainage and aeration . The bin sits atop two sawhorses . Mom lifts the lid . " Bon apptit ! " she says , as if the worms can hear her and understand . Everyone clusters around the bin , tipping cereal bowls so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing I 'd faint if I caught even a glimpse of pink in the dirt . Once the lid is safely closed , I notice a couple bales of straw against the garage wall . " What 's with that ? " I point my spoon . " It 's for the winter , " Mom says . " Eventually , I 'm going to use the straw to protect the worms from the cold . " Worms sure are delicate , I think . Ca n't be too hot . Ca n't be too cold . My mind turns to murder . Premeditated murder . A heating pad shoved into the worm bedding . Or ice cubes . Ice cubes would be better , I decide . The evidence would melt . No murder weapon would be found , and I 'd be in the clear . Except for one problem . There 's no way I 'd be able to stick my hand in that bin to shove anything down .

Most of the time , I manage to finish every sliver of food on my plate , just so I can avoid being in the presence ofthat bin . The worms are always on my mind anyway , though . My bedroom is above the garage , and sometimes I lie awake in the middle of the night worried that the floor will collapse and I 'll fall into oodles of worms . Or out of the blue , I 'll feel slimy and gross for no reason at all . Sharing my home with those things is a living nightmare ! It 's a Saturday morning , and Mom is out of town visiting my aunt . Dad woke up early to take Avery to an indoor soccer tournament . Carter is still sleeping , and I 'm eating breakfast . I look out the kitchen window and see a light dusting of first snow .

I scream a top-of-my-lungs scream , hoping Carter will come to rescue me . I continue screaming until I realize Carter is n't coming . I also realize some of the worms are no longer wiggling . They 're dead . I watch helplessly as worms drop from the holes at the bottom of the bin onto the floor below . Maybe I should close the door and not tell anyone . Maybe the worms will all die .

I tumble downstairs and call mom . " The worms ! They 're dropping onto the floor , " I yell into the phone . Mom sounds upset . She explains that when it turns cold , worms burrow into the ground to find warmth . Since these guys were n't in the ground , they burrowed themselves right out of the drainage holes in the bottom of the bin . She thought it was n't supposed to get that cold overnight . " You have to act fast , " she says . " Round up the worms that are still alive and put them back in the bin . Take the bin off the sawhorses and move it closer to the ground .

I avoid looking down , fearful I 'll toss them into the air in a fit of fright , and carry pile after pile to the bin . When the floor is finally clear , I scurry upstairs to wake Carter . " Mom says we have to move the bin . Now ! " He stumbles sleepily down the stairs after me . Carter and I move the bin to the ground , shaking straw around it .

@@4022050 S. L. Gilbow is making a reputation for himself as a storyteller with a sharp eye for social commentary - several critics marked him as a writer to watch after reading his stories " Who Brought Tulips to the Moon ? " ( Dec. 2007 ) and " Red Card " ( Feb. 2007 ) . His new story is lighter in tone , but just as keenly observant of how technology tends to change human lives . // ON A NOVEMBER FRIDAY morning , Jerry Morgan attended his funeral at the Cotton Springs Methodist Church . It was n't a bad funeral . His daughter , Jill , flew her Cessna in from Saint Louis , and his son , Buddy , drove up from El Paso six hours away . The townspeople of Cotton Springs turned out in good numbers too , solemnly filing into the old , brick church , filling all the pews except for a few closest to the front . Cotton Springs was a small , close-knit community where funerals tended to draw good crowds . The service proceeded much as Jerry had planned . Jennifer Garland , the church organist for twenty-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She bobbed her head in rhythm to the music , striking each key with precision , artfully working the pedals with her feet . Jennifer hit her final B-flat with the left heel of her patent leather Mary Janes and held it as Jill and Buddy somberly marched to the front of the church , stood behind the coffin , and began to sing : " Freude , schner Gtterfunken , Tochter aus Elysium . " This surprised Jerry . He had planned for Jill and Buddy to sing " I 'll Fly Away . " But here they were , bold and passionate , making their way through " Ode to Joy , " Jerry 's favorite song . Jerry had learned to sing it in German while in the Army , and belted it out around the house whenever he was in a good mood . " Wir betreten feuertrunken , Himmlische , dein Heiligtum , " whispered Jerry . Jill sang with a passable German accent she learned at Texas Tech , but Buddy butchered his vowels with a thick west-Texas drawl . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jill and Buddy finished singing and stepped away from the coffin , Reverend Hackam ambled to the podium and began to talk about what a wonderful person Jerry had been for the past sixty-eight years , about how well he had treated his neighbors , about what fine contributions Jerry and his small store , Grocery Delite , had made to this humble community . Jerry agreed with almost everything the reverend said but disliked the dry , monotonous way he said it . " Jerry was a fine man , " droned Reverend Hackam , " a good person to have known . " Jerry had hoped for a little more enthusiasm . The spray of roses on top of Jerry 's coffin bothered him too . Jerry and Rebecca had talked about the funeral in great detail two weeks before Jerry died . She had come to his hospital room late one night , knowing Jerry did n't have much time left . Rebecca did n't want to talk about death or dying , but Jerry brought up the subject . He usually avoided serious topics , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her how he pictured the funeral . He talked about songs and singers . He selected his casket from a newspaper ad for Hank Jenson 's Funeral Home down on Austin Street , picking out the deluxe oak coffin with thin silver bands that ran around it like racing stripes . Finally , Jerry asked for red flowers . He loved his ruby-red Ford pick-up truck and hoped red roses might remind everybody of it . But the flowers on top of Jerry 's coffin were n't red . They were yellow - as yellow as canaries . " Why the yellow flowers ? " asked Jerry , gazing at his oak coffin . " They were out of red roses , " whispered Rebecca . " Now be quiet . " " I would have settled for carnations . " " Shhh ! " " You 're the only one who can hear me , " said Jerry . Rebecca had been short with Jerry all morning , and he was growing tired of it . " We 're in a church , " said Rebecca . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was having trouble getting used to Jerry being in two places at once - in the casket and around her neck . " I guess the yellow flowers are okay , " said Jerry . " They 're fine , " said Rebecca , trying to be patient . She had been listening to Jerry through an earpiece that ran from her right ear to a gold locket hanging over the center of her chest . And that 's where Jerry wasin the locket . Well , not exactly in the locket - Jerry was the locket . THINGS CAME SLOWLY to Cotton Springs . When Martha Jenson brought the first washing machine to town in 1926 , Frank Hapsen acted as if the whole world might come to an end . " Ai n't got no use for that kind of thing around here , " he would say whenever anyone would listen to him . But the world did n't come to an end , and Frank 's wife , Mary , washed his shirts by hand until he died in 1937 . Then she bought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years technology crept into Cotton Springs . Always slowly . Usually grudgingly . But it always came . Washing machines , telephones , cameras , radios , televisions , hot air popcorn poppers , microwave ovens , computers , and cell phones all worked their way out of Fort Worth , down Interstate 20 to the west , and over the state highway into Cotton Springs . It was no surprise when the Eternilocket finally came to town as well . By the time it got to Cotton Springs , the rest of the country had already played around with it for five years and was beginning to grow bored . When Infinite Electronics came out with the Eternilocket , people were fascinated with the idea of downloading a person 's personality and memories into a locket . The locket could be brought out to help the next of kin get through the grieving process . It was also pretty handy when you could n't find the will . However , many people complained that the lockets just did n't capture the beloved 's true personality . Others pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few just grew tired of arguing with jewelry . By the time the Eternilocket came to Cotton Springs , by the time Jerry Morgan had one programmed at his hospital bed less than a week away from dying , almost all the rest of the country was done with it . " And , of course , Jerry was more concerned with the mule 's hoof than his own head , " said Reverend Hackam . Laughter rose from the crowd , that quiet respectful kind of laughter you occasionally hear at weddings , funerals , and fancy restaurants . " That 's not really how it happened , " said Jerry . The mule story had been going around for about ten years now , and it seemed to change a little every time someone told it . " Hush , " said Rebecca . " I got kicked in the shoulder , " said Jerry . " It was nowhere near my head . " " It does n't matter , " said Rebecca . " And Jerry was a passionate man , " continued the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really how he would have described himself . " We all know how much Jerry loved his wife , Rebecca . " Jerry could sense himself dip as Rebecca bowed her head . " And of course we all know that Jerry loved Jacks , " said the reverend . Jerry brightened at the mention of Jacks . He had even wanted Rebecca to bring Jacks to the funeral , but Rebecca had refused , saying it would be silly to let a dog into a church . " You really should have let me bring him , " said Jerry . Rebecca grasped the locket and dug the small red jewel , Jerry 's eyes in a sense , into the palm of her hand , squeezing hard . " I ca n't see ! " shouted Jerry . " You going to be quiet ? " asked Rebecca . " All right , " said Jerry . " Not a word , " whispered Rebecca , releasing Jerry from her grasp . He dropped to his place between her breasts . " All right , " said Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another word , but he could n't resist . " I know Jacks would have been good . " " That 's it ! " shouted Rebecca as Jerry sank into darkness . When Jerry came to , he heard barking , low and muffled , coming from another room . He thought Rebecca had brought him home but , looking straight up at the ceiling , could n't be certain . After a few seconds , he recognized a gaping crack in the corner molding , a crack Rebecca had begged him to fix many times , and knew Rebecca had laid him on the dresser in their bedroom . " Rebecca ! " shouted Jerry . He no longer spoke through the earpiece , and his voice , strong and metallic , almost like shouting into a frying pan , startled him . " Rebecca , " he said softer . " Yes ? " She was close . Of course , she had to be close . Jerry could n't have , switched himself back on . " What are you doing ? " " Jerry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course it is , " said Jerry , still disoriented , still gazing up at the ceiling . " Just put me on again . We can talk . " Jerry had n't been much of a talker when he was alive . He could do small talk , but he usually avoided serious conversation . Serious talking was one of those things he occasionally endured to keep his marriage going . But now , since he no longer had legs or arms. - or even a torso or head for that matter - his choice of activities was extremely limited . " Please , " he pleaded . " Just put me on for a little while and then we can talk . " Jerry 's view spun around wildly as Rebecca liffted him off the dresser and fastened the locket 's thin chain around her neck . When Jerry stopped spinning , he found himself looking in a mirror , looking at Rebecca , looking at a gold locket engraved with tiny flowers . In the center of the locket sat a glassy red jewel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jacks scratched at the bedroom door , barking loudly . He was a large golden retriever , usually calm and quiet . Jerry had owned dogs for almost his entire life , but favored Jacks over all the rest . " Can I see Jacks ? " asked Jerry . " He wo n't recognize you , " said Rebecca . " And he 's kind of excited today . " " We can at least try . " Rebecca opened the door , jacks dashed in , arced around her and emitted a low guttural sound , not quite a growl . Jerry thought Jacks was a beautiful dog . Not perfect . Certainly not a show dog . His shoulders stood too high and his head was too broad . He had a pink nose and a thick , dark coat . Rebecca backed away slowly as Jacks , tail wagging , body shifting from side to side , jumped closer . " I told you , " she said . She turned to look out the open bedroom window thinking that if she ignored Jacks he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could still see Jacks at the edge of his vision . " Jacks ! " said Jerry . That usually quieted him . Jacks dipped his head for a second , regained his courage and barked again . " Get back , " said Jerry . Jacks took one step back and sank obediently to the floor . " We need to talk , Jerry , " said Rebecca . As Jerry looked out the bedroom window , he could see the neighbor 's cat skulking about next to the large cottonwood tree at the end of the alley . She was a large gray beast Jerry and Jacks had grown to dislike . She always seemed to be sneaking onto the Morgans ' property to prowl through the garbage cans at the back of the house . " Cat ! " shouted Jerry . Jacks jumped once , turned and dashed downstairs . Jerry heard the pet door slap open and close and watched Jacks race into the yard outside . The cat , always expecting danger to be somewhere close , sprang up the cottonwood tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry and Rebecca were alone now . " Jerry , this is n't going to work , " said Rebecca , returning to the mirror so she could look at Jerry as she spoke . " What do you mean ? " " Jerry is dead , " she said . " I 'm right here . " " No , you 're not , " she said , her voice quavering . " It 's not the same . " Jerry did n't know what to say . He felt the same . Or at least he thought he did . How could he really be sure ? " It 's not the same , " Rebecca said again . " It 's all right , " said Jerry . " It 'll just take some getting used to . " " Getting used to ? Getting used to what ? Getting used to you hanging around my neck all the time ? " " I am kind of limited in moving about , " said Jerry . " It 's over , Jerry . I hung with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't , " said Jerry . Rebecca stared into the mirror , stared into her own brown eyes . She had shoulder-length gray hair and smooth , olive skin , except for a tiny scar on her left cheek . " I was there for you , Jerry . " She did n't seem to be addressing Jerry at all now . " I was there when you joined the Army . I was there when you came home . " Her face was strong and her voice tense . " I was there when you tried to open that store with almost no money . I was there to raise two kids with you . I was there to take care of you when you were dying . " She started to cry . " I was there as cancer was eating you up . I was there , Jerry . I was there . " " I know , " said Jerry . He did n't know what else to say . Rebecca stared past Jerry , looking at herself , deep into herself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories of lockets being tossed into the trash while they were still on . Infinite Electronics strongly discouraged that , even printing a banner on the Eternilocket directions : PLEASE TURN LOCKETS OFF BEFORE DISCARDING . Rebecca followed directions . She would turn Jerry off before tossing him into the garbage . At least that gave Jerry some consolation . " What 's going to happen now ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " said Rebecca . Jerry was quiet . Even a Uttle afraid . He had never felt so powerless . THE GRAY CAT SANK low to the ground and stretched her plump body out as far as she could . She smeUed fish coming from the garbage behind the large house next door .

" Here , Kitty ! " A voice . A voice was near . The gray cat froze , determined she was safe , and then turned her head slowly , looking for a human to go with the voice . She looked at the discarded lettuce hanging out of the cans ; she looked up and down the alley ; she looked at the azalea bushes framing the back of the large house . No one was there . She had been chased away from garbage cans by people many times before , but there had always been a body to go with the voice . But there was no body now , so she went back to sniffing about .

@@4022055 Sometimes , in the terrible silence of the desert , a man can hear his soul cry out . By Zane Grey , excerpted from his novel // A face haunted Cameron-a woman 's face . It was there in the white heart of the dying campfire ; it hung in the shadows that hovered over the flickering light ; it drifted in the darkness beyond . This hour , when the day had closed and the lonely desert night set in with its dead silence , was one in which Cameron 's mind was thronged with memories of a time long past-of a home back in Peoria , of a woman he had wronged and lost , and loved too late . He was a prospector for gold , a hunter of solitude , a lover of the dreary , rockribbed infinitude , because he wanted to be alone to remember . A sound disturbed Cameron 's reflections . He bent his head listening . A soft wind fanned the paling embers , blew sparks and white ashes and thin smoke away into the enshrouding circle of blackness . His burro did not appear to be moving about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It rose strange , wild , mournful-not the howl of a prowling upland beast baying the campfire or barking at a lonely prospector , but the wail of a wolf , full-voiced , crying out the meaning of the desert and the night . Hunger throbbed in ithunger for a mate , for offspring , for life . When it ceased , the terrible desert silence smote Cameron , and the cry echoed in his soul . He and that wandering wolf were brothers . Then a sharp clink of metal on stone and soft pads of hoofs in sand prompted Cameron to reach for his gun , and to move out of the light of the waning campfire . He was somewhere along the wild border line between Sonora and Arizona ; and the prospector who dared the heat and barrenness of that region risked other dangers sometimes as menacing . Figures darker than the gloom approached and took shape , and in the light turned out to be those of a white man and a heavily packed burro . " Hello there , " the man called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I saw your fire . May I make camp here ? " Cameron came forth out of the shadow and greeted his visitor , whom he took for a prospector like himself . Cameron resented the breaking of his lonely campfire vigil , but he respected the law of the desert . The stranger thanked him , and then slipped the pack from his burro . Then he rolled out his pack and began preparations for a meal . His movements were slow and methodical . Cameron watched him , still with resentment , yet with a curious and growing interest . The campfire burst into a bright blaze , and by its light Cameron saw a man whose gray hair somehow did not seem to make him old , and whose stooped shoulders did not detract from an impression of rugged strength . " Find any mineral ? " asked Cameron , presently His visitor looked up quickly , as if startled by the sound of a human voice . He replied , and then the two men talked a little . But the stranger evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent a keener gaze upon the furrowed , shadowy face . Another of those strange desert prospectors in whom there was some relentless driving power besides the lust for gold ! Cameron felt that between this man and himself there was a subtle affinity , vague and undefined , perhaps born of the divination that here was a desert wanderer like himself , perhaps born of a deeper , an unintelligible relation having its roots back in the past . A long-forgotten sensation stirred in Cameron 's breast , one so long forgotten that he could not recognize it . But it was akin to pain . When he awakened he found , to his surprise , that his companion had departed . A trail in the sand led off to the north . There was no water in that direction . Cameron shrugged his shoulders ; it was not his affair ; he had his own problems . And straightway he forgot his strange visitor . Cameron began his day , grateful for the solitude that was now unbroken , for the canyon-furrowed and cactus-spired scene that now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never straying far from the dry stream bed ; and in a desultory way , without eagerness , he hunted for signs of gold .

What the vast silent world meant to him had always been a mystical thing , which he felt in all its incalculable power , but never understood . That day , while it was yet light , and he was digging in a moist white-bordered wash for water , he was brought sharply up by hearing the crack of hard hoofs on stone . There down the canyon came a man and a burro . Cameron recognized them . " Hello , friend , " called the man , halting . " Our trails crossed again . That 's good . " " Hello , " replied Cameron , slowly . " Any mineral sign today ? " " No . " They made camp together , ate their frugal meal , smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many words . In the morning the same reticence , the same aloofness characterized the manner of both . But Cameron 's companion , when he had packed his burro and was ready to start , faced about and said : " We might stay together , if it 's all right with you . " " I never take a partner , " replied Cameron . " You 're alone ; I 'm alone , " said the other , mildly " It 's a big place . If we find gold there 'll be enough for two . " " I do n't go down into the desert for gold alone , " rejoined Cameron , with a chill note in his swift reply . His companion 's deep-set , luminous eyes emitted a singular flash . It moved Cameron to say that in the years of his wandering he had met no man who could endure equally with him the blasting heat , the blinding dust storms , the wilderness of sand and rock and lava and cactus , the terrible silence and desolation of the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shadowy descent of plain and range . " I may strike through the Sonora Desert . I may head for Pinacate or north for the Colorado Basin . You are an old man . " " I do n't know the country , but to me one place is the same as another , " replied his companion . For moments he seemed to forget himself , and swept his far-reaching gaze out over the colored gulf of stone and sand . Then with gentle slaps he drove his burro in behind Cameron . " Yes , I 'm old . I 'm lonely , too . It 's come to me just lately . But , friend , I can still travel , and for a few days my company wo n't hurt you . " " Have it your way , " said Cameron . They began a slow march down into the desert . At sunset they camped under the lee of a low mesa . Cameron was glad his comrade had the Indian habit of silence . Another day 's travel found the prospectors deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve , noticeable in the elder man , almost imperceptibly gradual in Cameron . Beside the meager mesquite campfire this gray-faced , thoughtful old prospector would remove his black pipe from his mouth to talk a little ; and Cameron would listen , and sometimes unlock his lips to speak a word . And so , as Cameron began to respond to the influence of a desert less lonely than habitual , he began to take keener note of his comrade , and found him different from any other he had ever encountered in the wilderness . This man never grumbled at the heat , the glare , the driving sand , the sour water , the scant fare . During the daylight hours he was seldom idle . At night he sat dreaming before the fire or paced to and fro in the gloom . He slept but little , and that long after Cameron had had his own rest . He was tireless , patient , brooding . Cameron 's awakened interest brought home to him the realization that for years he had shunned companionship . In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and these had left their bones to bleach in the shifting sands . Cameron had not cared to know their secrets . But the more he studied this latest comrade the more he began to suspect that he might have missed something in the others . In his own driving passion to take his secret into the limitless abode of silence and desolation , where he could be alone with it , he had forgotten that life dealt shocks to other men . Somehow this silent comrade reminded him . Each succeeding day and night Cameron felt himself more and more drawn to this strange man . He found that after hours of burning toil he had insensibly grown nearer to his comrade . He reflected that after a few weeks in the desert he had always become a different man . In civilization , in the rough mining camps , he had been a prey to unrest and gloom . But once down on the great billowing sweep of this lonely world , he could look into his unquiet soul without bitterness . Did not the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , fighting cold , heat , starvation , thirst , barrenness , facing the elements in all their ferocity , usually retrograded , descended to the savage , lost all heart and soul and became mere brutes . Likewise he believed that men wandering or lost in the wilderness often reversed that brutal order of life and became noble , wonderful , super-human . So now he did not marvel at a slow stir stealing warmer along his veins , and at the premonition that perhaps he and this man , alone on the desert , driven there by life 's mysterious and remorseless motive , were to see each other through God 's eyes . His companion was one who thought of himself last . It humiliated Cameron that in spite of growing keenness he could not hinder him from doing more than an equal share of the day 's work . The man was mild , gentle , quiet , mostly silent , yet under all his softness he seemed to be made of the fiber of steel . Cameron could not thwart him . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for himself . Cameron 's hands always trembled at the turning of rock that promised gold ; he had enough of the prospector 's passion for fortune to thrill at the chance of a strike . But the other never showed the least trace of excitement . One night they were encamped at the head of a canyon . The day had been exceedingly hot , and long after sundown the radiation of heat from the rocks persisted . A desert bird whistled a wild , melancholy note from a dark cliff , and a distant coyote wailed mournfully . The stars shone white until the huge moon rose to burn out all their whiteness . And on this night Cameron watched his comrade , and yielded to interest he had not heretofore voiced . " Pardner , what drives you into the desert ? " " Do I seem to be a driven man ? " " No . But I feel it . Do you come to forget ? " " Yes . " " Ah ! " softly exclaimed Cameron . Always he seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man rise and begin his nightly pace to and fro , up and down . With slow , soft tread , forward and back , tirelessly and ceaselessly , he paced that beat . He did not look up at the stars or follow the radiant track of the moon along the canyon ramparts . He hung his head . He was lost in another world . It was a world which the lonely desert made real . He looked a dark , sad , plodding figure , and somehow impressed Cameron with the helplessness of men . Cameron grew acutely conscious of the pang in his own breast , of the fire in his heart , the strife and torment of his passion-driven soul . He had come into the desert to remember a woman . She appeared to him then as she had looked when first she entered his life-a goldenhaired girl , blue-eyed , whiteskinned , red-lipped , tall and slender and beautiful . He had never forgotten , and an old , sickening remorse knocked at his heart . He rose and climbed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he paced to and fro and looked down into the weird and mystic shadows , like the darkness of his passion , and farther on down the moon track and the glittering stretches that vanished in the cold , blue horizon . The moon soared radiant and calm , the white stars shone serene . The vault of heaven seemed illimitable and divine . The desert surrounded him , silverstreaked and black-mantled , a chaos of rock and sand , silent , austere , ancient , always waiting . It spoke to Cameron . It was a naked corpse , but it had a soul . In that wild solitude the white stars looked down upon him pitilessly and pityingly . They had shone upon a desert that might once have been alive and was now dead , and might again throb with life , only to die . It was a terrible ordeal for him to stand alone and realize that he was only a man facing eternity . But that was what gave him strength to endure . Somehow he was a part of it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inscrutable purpose , something indestructible in that desolate world of ruin and death and decay , something perishable and changeable and growing under all the fixity of heaven . In that endless , silent hall of desert there was a spirit ; and Cameron felt hovering near him what he imagined to be phantoms of peace . He returned to camp and sought his comrade . " I reckon we 're two of a kind , " he said . " It was a woman who drove me into the desert . But I come to remember . The desert 's the only place I can do that . " " Was she your wife ? " asked the elder man . " No . " A long silence ensued . A cool wind blew up the canyon , sifting the sand through the dry sage , driving away the last of the lingering heat . The campfire wore down to a ruddy ashen heap . " I had a daughter , " said Cameron 's comrade . " She lost her mother at birth . And I-I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the-the old story . " His words were peculiarly significant to Cameron . They distressed him . He had been wrapped up in his remorse . If ever in the past he had thought of any one connected with the girl he had wronged he had long forgotten . But the consequences of such wrong were far-reaching . They struck at the roots of a home . Here in the desert he was confronted by the spectacle of a splendid man , a father , wasting his life because he could not forget-because there was nothing left to live for . Cameron understood better now why his comrade was drawn by the desert . " Well , tell me more ? " asked Cameron , earnestly " It was the old , old story . My girl was pretty and free . The young bucks ran after her . I guess she did not run away from them . And I was away a good deal-working in another town . She was in love with a wild fellow . I knew nothing of it till too late . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back . And when the disgrace became plain to all , my girl left home . She went West . After a while I heard from her . She was well-workingliving for her baby . A long time passed . I had no ties . I drifted West . Her lover had also gone West . In those days everybody went West . I trailed him , intending to kill him . But I lost his trail . Neither could I find any trace of her . She had moved on , driven , no doubt , by the hound of her past . Since then I have taken to the wilds , hunting gold on the desert . " " Yes , it 's the old , old story , only sadder , I think , " said Cameron ; and his voice was strained and unnatural . " Pardner , what Illinois town was it you hailed from ? " " Peoria . " " And your-your name ? " went on Cameron huskily . " Warren-Jonas Warren . " That name might as well have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men sometimes stand momentarily when shot straight through the heart . In an instant , when thoughts resurged like blinding flashes of lightning through his mind , he was a swaying , quivering , terrorstricken man . He mumbled something hoarsely and backed into the shadow . But he need not have feared discovery , however surely his agitation might have betrayed him . Warren sat brooding over the campfire , oblivious of his comrade , absorbed in the past .

@@4022061 One // Jews bury themselves the way they live , crowded together , encroaching on one another 's space . The headstones were packed tight , the bodies underneath elbow to elbow and head to toe . Kaddish led Pato through uneven rows over uneven ground on the Benevolent Self side . He cupped his hand over the eye of the flashlight to smother the light . His fingers glowed orange , red in between , as he ran his fist along the face of a stone . // They were searching for Hezzi Two-Blades ' grave , and finding it did n't take long . His plot rose up sharply . His marker tipped back . It looked to Kaddish as if the old man had tried to claw his way free . It also looked like Two-Blades ' daughter had only to wait another winter and she would n't have needed to hire Kaddish Poznan at all . // Marble , Kaddish had discovered , is chiseled into not for its strength but for its softness . As with the rest of the marble in the graveyard of the Society of the Benevolent Self , Hezzi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the others were cut from granite . If nature and pollution did n't get to those , the local hooligans would . In the past , Kaddish had scrubbed away swastikas and cemented back broken stones . He tested the strength of the one over Two-Blades ' grave . " Like taking a swing at a loose tooth , " Kaddish said . " I do n't even know why we bother -- a little longer and no sign of this place will remain . " // But Kaddish and Pato both knew why they bothered . They understood very well why the families turned to them with such urgency now . It was 1976 in Argentina . They lived with uncertainty and looming chaos . In Buenos Aires they 'd long suffered kidnap and ransom . There was terror from all quarters and murder on the rise . It was no time to stand out , not for Gentile or Jew . And the Jews , almost to a person , felt that being Jewish was already plenty different enough . // Kaddish 's clients were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successful segment of their community that did n't have in its families such a reputable past . In quieter times it had been enough to ignore and deny . When the last of the generation of the Benevolent Self had gone silent , when all the plots on their side were full , the descendants waited what they thought was a decent amount of time for an indecent bunch and sealed up that graveyard for good . // When he went to visit his mother 's grave and found the gate locked , Kaddish turned to the other children of the Benevolent Self for the key . They denied involvement . They were surprised to learn of the cemetery 's existence . And when Kaddish pointed out that their parents were buried there , they proved equally unable to recall their own parents ' names . // Harsh a stance as this was , it was born of a terrible shame . // Not only was the Society of the Benevolent Self a scandal in Buenos Aires , at its height in the 1920s it was a disgrace beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't enjoy in his morning paper a good picture of an alfonse in handcuffs , a Caftan member in a lineup -- who did n't feel his reviling justified at the sight of the famous Jewish pimps of Buenos Aires accompanied by their pouty-lipped Jewish whores ? But this was long over in 1950 , when Kaddish found himself locked outside the gate . That terrible industry as a Jewish business was by then twenty years shut down . The buildings that belonged to the Society of the Benevolent Self were long sold off , the pimps ' shul abandoned . There was only one holding that could n't possibly fall into disuse . Disrepair , yes . And derelict , too . But , like a riddle , what 's the only thing man can build that is guaranteed perpetual use ? The dead use a graveyard forever . // That cemetery was also the only institution established by the pimps and whores of Buenos Aires that was built with a concession from the upstanding Jews . Hard-hearted as those Jews were when it came to theBenevolent Self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of the fledgling United Jewish Congregations of Argentina was convened and an impasse reached . No Jew should have to be buried as a Gentile , God help them . But neither should the fine Jews of Buenos Aires have to lie among whores . They shared their quandary with Talmud Harry , who , as leader of the Benevolent Self , sat at the head of a board of his own . " You lie with them living , " Harry said , " why not cuddle up when they 're dead ? " // Eventually it was agreed . A wall to match the one surrounding the graveyard would be built toward the back and a second cemetery formed that was really part of the first -- technically but not halachically , which is how Jews solve every problem that comes their way . // The existing wall was a modest two meters , a functional barrier meant to set off a sacred space . The establishment of a Jewish cemetery in a city obsessed with its dead had signaled a level of acceptance of which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ease in its design . // But being accepted one day does n't mean one will be welcome the next -- the Jews of Buenos Aires could n't resist planning for dark times . So atop that modest wall they 'd affixed another two meters of wrought-iron fence , each bar with a fleur-de-lis on its end . All those points and barbs four meters up gave that wall an unwelcoming , unclimbable , pants-ripping feel . The United Congregations allowed themselves one hint at grandeur in the form of a columned entryway capped with a dome . Before any balance was achieved among the Jews , this was the one they 'd struck with the outside world . // Two sets of board members stood watching the new wall go up . The Westernized Liberator 's shul rabbi had declined to attend . It was the young old-country rabbi who paced nervously , making sure certain standards were met and horrified to find himself presiding . // When the mortar had dried , the governors of the United Congregations returned for the installation of the fence . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a sight those upstanding Jews had hoped never to see again . A line of famed Benevolent Self toughs stood before them , including a still-robust Hezzi Two-Blades , Coconut Burstein , and Hayim-Moshe " One-Eye " Weiss . Towering over Talmud Harry was the very large , very legendary Shlomo the Pin . // " The wall is plenty high enough , " Talmud Harry said . " A fence is an insult that need not be made . " The Jews of the United Congregations did n't think it was an insult ; they thought it would match nicely with the fencing all around . A number of ugly threats were already implicit . There was nothing much Harry needed to add . He pointed at the wall and said only , " This is as separate as it gets . " // Their faces went long . They turned to the rabbi , but he could n't support them . A solid two-meter wall was a separation by any standard : It would suffice for mechitza or sukkah or to pen a goring ox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry gave the nod . A jittery Two-Blades began to reach , and Shlomo the Pin rolled the fingers of his right hand into a tight cudgel-like fist . Feigenblum , the first president of the United Congregations and father to the second , saw this out of the corner of his eye . He took it as an excellent moment to declare the young rabbi 's word binding , and a speedy departure was made . // The pimps did n't want to be second-class any more than their brothers who 'd demanded a wall in between . When they put up the facade to their cemetery they commissioned a replica -- but one meter higher -- of the grand domed entrance that welcomed mourners into the United Congregations side . // Thank God again that it was settled . It allowed Talmud Harry to die in peace and be spared the sight of his own sons , lawyers both , facing Kaddish in the living rooms of their big houses and denying whence they came . It was the same when meeting with One-Eye 's daughter and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had was fought for and paid for the Benevolent Self way . // It was Lila Finkel -- whose mother , Bryna the Vagina , was said to have an incisive perspicacity as well as a cunt of pure gold -- who took it upon herself to set Kaddish straight . " Take a breath , " she said . Kaddish took one . " Do you smell it in the air ? " she asked . Kaddish thought he might . " That 's what good fortune smells like , Poznan . It 's the season of our prosperity and it 's never come this way before . " // It was the heyday of Evita , of the liberated worker and her shirtless ones . Factories were rising up under Peron , and Lila drew for Kaddish a picture of the middle class rising with them and making room for the Jews . All she asked was that he join them in looking forward . No reason to dwell on ugly memories soon forgotten . Kaddish was n't convinced , and Lila 's patience began to wear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good solid tap to her temple . " Which man is better off " -- another riddle -- " the one without a future or the one without a past ? That 's why the wall went up . So that one day the Jews might join together , so we could stand in the United Congregations Cemetery out of joy , not sadness , and all of us , looking toward that wall , might together forget what 's on the other side . " // Except that , for Kaddish Poznan , the future looked no brighter than the past . He 'd not yet met and married Lillian ; it was before the birth of his son . Without his mother Favorita 's grave to visit , Kaddish had no one at all . // " So what ? " Lila said . " In every people 's history there are times best forgotten . This is ours , Poznan . Let it go . " // Among the children who did n't acknowledge their parents ' existence , someone else aside from Lila had been unnerved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cemetery bent on getting in , Kaddish found a chain had been added to the gate , a sloppy weld applied , and , for good measure , tar used to gum up the keyholes in both locks . He gave it a kick that echoed off the dome and sent a pigeon swooping down from above . Kaddish thought about what Lila said and went around to the United Congregations side . He entered through its always-open gate , he walked through its manicured grounds , and reaching it -- reaching up , Kaddish scraped his shoes against brick as he pulled himself to the top of that wall . Perched there and taking in the Benevolent Self , Kaddish wondered if there 'd ever been a wall built that someone had n't managed to cross . This one was n't much of a challenge . It was n't meant to stop the living but to separate the dead . // As a solution it was fine with Kaddish and , as word spread , with the rest of the Jewish community from both sides of the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self or dropping back down between United Congregations plots . No one acknowledged he was there . If they could forget every last person buried in that ruffians ' graveyard , it was n't difficult to add one more . From then on , it was as if he was n't . The Jews forgot Kaddish Poznan too . // This is how it stayed for a very long time . It was how Kaddish was treated after he fell in love with Lillian and when she , God bless her , fell in love right back . The Jews of Buenos Aires made room for her in their forgetting -- no small matter , considering her family aligned itself on the United Congregations side . ( Pity also the parents . What to do with a daughter who insists on marrying an hijo de puta ? Why did Lillian have to find herself the only Jew proud to be a son of a whore ? ) This is how the situation remained for them when Evita died two years later , and in five , when Peron was driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became ever more frequent after Pato was born . His mother was the family 's single unbroken link to a past . // Not even Kaddish 's name was family given ; it was the young rabbi who 'd picked it and , no more than a half kindness , it was the most the upstanding Jews had ever shown . Sickly , weakly , and grasping at survival , Kaddish barely lived through his first week . His mother -- a faithful woman -- begged that the rabbi be summoned to Talmud Harry 's to save him . The rabbi would n't cross the threshold . Standing in the sunlight out on Cashew Street , he peered into the vestibule at the infant in Favorita 's arms . His judgment was instant . " Let his name be Kaddish to ward off the angel of death . A trick and a blessing . Let this child be the mourner instead of the mourned . " Assuming no fathering beyond the physical ( and commercial ) act , the rabbi gave Kaddish the last name that goes with the legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's offspring through a prostitute will come to no good . Favorita repeated the name : Kaddish Poznan . She held out Kaddish and gave him a turn , as if trying it on for size . The rabbi did n't smile or take leave . He simply stepped out into the gutter , feeling he 'd done right by the child . Let the name Kaddish save him . And if the boy is righteous , let him get out of the other one on his own . // Had Kaddish known the origins of his name , he would n't have felt cursed . He was happy with his family . He believed in a bright future for his son . And as creaky as his knees were when he climbed that wall , as lightly and with as little oomph as he tried to land , he had n't given up on his own self either . If she 'd acknowledged him in the intervening twenty-five years , Kaddish would have told Lila Finkel she was partly right . Hard as life got , there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was why Kaddish never needed his fellow Jews any more than they needed him . // This was the balance maintained through the Montoneros and the ERP and after Ongania was overthrown . During those two decades , the community prospered and attained status . And Kaddish was convinced he 'd have prospered most of all had any of his schemes worked out . // The Jews did n't feel any great need to take stock when Peron returned to power . It surely did n't make them think about Kaddish Poznan 's treatment all those years . The community did give a collective twitch when , during Peron 's welcome home , there was a small massacre in the welcoming crowd . There were some in Once and Villa Crespo who bounced their knees nervously throughout Peron 's short reign and two brothers in two big houses in Palermo who began to bite their nails in earnest when he died . // Continues ...

She felt unsatisfied and a bit cheated . // Evelyn was drawn toward a picture that hung in the place of honor above the phone and straightened it . The artist was five-year-old Summer . The biggest blessing amidst the wistfulness was that Summer was officially hers now .

Sometimes she felt like an extremely elderly fifty-seven-year-old , while Mae made over-fifty look positively youthful . // Mae took the porch steps two at a time and snapped her on the shoulder . " How 's the landlord business ? How many you got filled ? " // " None . " // " None ? " // Evelyn shook her head . // " What 's up with this town ? They do n't know what they 're missing . I loved my months at Peerbaugh Place . " // " Care to move back in ? " // Mae leaned close . " You 'll find people , Evie .

And it will be again , to another set of ladies . " // " It wo n't be the same . They wo n't be sisters . " // " We were n't sisters either . Not at first . " // " But why is it taking so long ?

" // " He did it the first time , did n't He ? We 've all admitted that . " // Evelyn put a hand over her eyes . " Oh dear ... I 'm so ashamed . I did n't pray ; I have n't asked- " // " Hey , better late than never .

And maybe it did n't matter . Why not enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got you . // Evelyn turned back to Mae , taking her hand . " Will you pray with me ? " // " You betcha.

All external clues said yes , and yet ... // Heddy was the essence of polite , calling Evelyn " Mrs. Peerbaugh " and saying " yes , ma'am " and " no , ma'am . " Her nose kept her from crossing the line from pretty to beautiful , and her long wavy hair and pale skin joined with her delicate frame to give her an ethereal quality . She wore a voile skirt that undulated around her legs , along with a classic cardigan set in the palest seafoam green . Both reinforced her femininity yet were a bit disconcerting , being out of season . // As for her age ? It was hard to say . Definitely over thirty , but beyond that , Evelyn was n't sure . Whatever her age , her lissome daintiness made Evelyn a bit pouty about the fifteen extra pounds that had settled around her middle since her fortieth birthday . While Evelyn walked through a room , Heddy seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that dancer at the turn of the century who used all the fl owing scarves . The woman gave the notion that she was there but not there , that any moment a breeze would pass through the room and take her away , leaving an observer wondering if anyone had ever been there at all . // Heddy made a third trip back to Mae 's old room . " I like this one best . I adore the balcony . If it 's all right with you , Mrs. Peerbaugh , I 'll take it . " // Evelyn blinked twice , shocked to actually hear the words she 'd been waiting-and praying-to hear . " That 's wonderful . " // " I have good references , " Heddy said . // Evelyn had nearly forgotten her landlord duties . " I 'm sure you do . Let 's go downstairs . I have an application for you to fill out .

Surely that indicated stability . Did Evelyn really have to call her references ? Could n't she just tell Heddy yes right now ? // Heddy had gotten up from the table and was taking in the room . " This furniture is lovely . They do n't make pieces like this anymore . Solid . Graceful detail . I do n't abide by modern-looking pieces with straight lines and no adornment . " // She likes antiques . " They 're family heirlooms . " // Heddy ran a finger along the walnut hutch . " Hmm ... family ... " // " Do you have family ? " // Heddy opened her mouth to answer , then closed it . " Some . " She moved to the silver tea service that sat on a cart by the window . " Ooh , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I remember my mother-in-law using it when we used to come to Sunday supper . " // " So you did n't grow up here ? " // " It 's my husband 's family home .

It was bare . " Have you ever been married ? " // Heddy suddenly looked at her watch . " I 'm sorry . I have to get to work . It 's a new job . They want to show me around . " // " Where are you working ? " // " I just got a job as the hostess at Ruby 's Diner . I hope I do a good job for them . " She headed toward the door . Evelyn was impressed with her sincerity . She glanced at the application form , then at Heddy , whose hand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the formalities . You want the room , it 's yours . " // Heddy smiled wide , revealing a perfect set of teeth . " That would be grand . When can I move in ? " // " Anytime . " " This afternoon ? I 'll be off work at two . " // Evelyn was a bit taken aback , but said , " Certainly . " // They shook hands , but as soon as Heddy left , Evelyn felt a stitch in her stomach . Now that 's an odd reaction . // She pushed the feeling away . // One room down . Two to go . // * * * // The doorbell rang . A knock followed . Before Evelyn could get to the landing , another knock . // " Coming ! " Evelyn saw the shadow of a woman through the leaded glass . The bell rang again just as she opened the door . Evelyn had rarely seen such a large woman . She was dressed stylishly , but two Evelyns could have fit into her clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She waved a hand at the Peerbaugh Place sign swinging in the breeze . // Evelyn caught her mouth before it gaped .

" She stuck out a hand . // They shook hands across the doorway . " Evelyn Peerbaugh. " // There was a moment of awkward silence . " Well ?

@@4022075 He had to be the luckiest man on earth , Kent Grosso mused as he straightened the knot in an expensive red silk tie he wore with a crisp white shirt and an immaculately tailored dark suit . He had the career of his dreams , his first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship trophy , a wonderfully close and supportive family and an amazing girlfriend . Some people had suggested that Kent led a charmed life , and he was inclined to agree . // Stepping back , he gave a last cursory check to his appearance in the mirror on his dressing room wall . Brown hair neatly combed , face closely shaved , suit pressed and lint-free . He should pass muster at the party later that evening . There seemed to be a never-ending string of social events during the three months between race seasons . Especially now , just over a week before the new season began . // As defending NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion , Kent had a dizzying number of professional obligations lined up for the next weeks , but he was n't complaining . This was what he 'd worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his father 's footsteps . His only regret was that his dad had n't yet won a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship . Still a competitive driver at almost forty-nine , Dean Grosso had never finished a season number-one in points , though he 'd come heartbreakingly close a time or two . This year 's top finisher would be given the title of NASCAR Sprint Cup Champion , and Dean was determined to win that honor . // Pushing his dad 's racing history to the back of his mind , Kent walked to the dresser in his brown-and-black decorated bedroom and opened a top drawer . He pulled out a small royal blue velvet box and held it in his palm without opening it . He did n't have to see the diamond-and-platinum ring to visualize it ; he 'd studied it often enough , trying to decide exactly when to present it to Tanya . // He 'd had his share of girlfriends during his thirty years , but this was the first time he 'd actually considered asking someone to marry him . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come before her . He 'd never envisioned himself giving up his bachelor-hood for them , or raising a family with them , or growing old with them . // He pictured all of those things when he thought of Tanya Wells . // Slipping the ring box into the inner pocket of his jacket , he swallowed hard as he decided that tonight could be the night . He was getting tired of waiting for just the right moment . He wanted to see that diamond glittering on her left hand . He 'd be the proudest man in the world to call her his wife , he thought with a smile that just might look sappy had anyone been around to see it . // He was ready too early . Restless , he paced through his townhouse apartment , too aware of the silence in the spacious rooms .

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tanya would have to start talking about a house once they were engaged , he thought . Maybe she 'd like to have one designed and built to her specifications .

To kill time , he sat at his computer and logged on to his e-mail account . Might as well check to see if there were any messages he needed to respond to before he headed out . // TANYA WAS BARELY READY in time for her date with Kent .

She had n't known much about NASCAR before she 'd met Kent , though her brothers had been casual fans for years .

Fortunately , she and Kent had found a comfortable rhythm between their personal lives and professional obligations . She enjoyed every minute she spent with him , but she also had a richly fulfilling career of her own . As far as she was concerned , they were perfect for each other . // The doorbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already spreading across her face . She opened the door to find Kent standing on the other side . Even though they had been together almost two years , her heart still tripped at the sight of him . She wondered if there would ever come a time when she did not react that way . // " Hi . " She lifted her face for his greeting . // " You look beautiful , " he murmured , and then proceeded to kiss away every bit of the lip gloss she had just applied . // By the time he drew back , they were both breathless and laughing . // " Are you sure we have to go to this thing tonight ?

An organic-foods distributor , Vittle Farms had been Kent 's primary sponsor for several seasons . They 'd considered him well worth the expense all along , since he was particularly good at promoting his sponsor in every interview and personal appearance . Now that he 'd won a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship , he was even more the golden boy to this crowd . // " He 's so hot , " Melissa murmured , practically licking her lips as she studied Kent . // " I 'd settle for someone half as good-looking and interesting , but all I 've dated lately are frogs . " // " Trust me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frogs , myself , " Tanya replied with a sympathetic smile . She could n't help thinking of her last serious relationship , which had imploded very painfully when she 'd learned that Michael had been unfaithful to her almost from the beginning . // He had been the most charming , personable and skilled deceiver she had ever encountered , and she 'd been young , impressionable and too trusting . She 'd fallen hook , line and sinker for his spiel-until a couple of her best friends had finally arranged an intervention of sorts and had opened her eyes to the truth . Her pride had been shattered and her heart bruised , but she 'd emerged from the experience with a new maturity and strength . She wanted to believe that she would never be that gullible again . " I 'd all but quit looking for a prince when I met Kent almost two years ago . " // " Well , maybe there 's hope for me yet . " Melissa shook her head , causing the glittering green earrings dangling from her lobes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ever be as lucky as you are.You and Kent are so perfect together . " // The words were eerily close to what Tanya , herself , had been thinking earlier . And all of a sudden they made her a bit nervous , almost as if she were afraid something would jinx the very special relationship she had with Kent . After all , she had thought Michael was perfect , too , she remembered with a hard swallow . // But that was silly , of course . She was n't at all superstitious . She and Kent really were great together . He was nothing at all like Michael . As Melissa had said , Tanya was the luckiest woman in the room . // IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT , if frosty .

" // " She left a couple of years ago , after the first wave of post-9/11 bombings . She 's kept the place just in case she ever wants to come back . I 'm keeping an eye on it for her . " // " So you 've been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it to sound congratulatory -- I was honestly happy for her -- but for some reason the compliment seemed to fall flat . // " Yes , " she said . " They 've been good years , except for this last . " // " You ca n't have been here since .... " // " Since you left me ? " She laughed -- with the hint of an edge . " Of course not . You must n't think that . We only stayed for a year after we got married . Then we had assignments in Jordan and Turkey , and finally in Ireland . Harry thought Dublin would be his last station . It was lovely . Harry called it his swan song posting . " // " Why swan song ? " // " I married an older man . It 's such a stock phrase , is n't it ? But we were in love . He 's much younger than his age . And there were advantages . He has a good position , we 've had money , the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a lonely tune , in a dying fall . It sounded self-consciously pat , as if she 'd practiced it too long , like a child who 's learned by rote their little story of achievement at school -- or their alibi . I asked her , " Why did you come back ? " // " Commerce and state are recalling all the old Saudi hands they can still find . The place is such a mess , they do n't want to leave it to junior officers . Harry 's even put off retirement for a year . They extended his service . We should have been safely back in Ireland by this time . " // " You 're settling down there ? " // " Harry 's in love with Ireland . He does n't want to retire to the States . " // " Surely you could leave , if you wanted to ? " // " In a minute . I 'm practically the last spouse left . I had to fight for permission to stay . " // It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles I 'd found a wife , but I 'd never found a woman who 'd insist on staying in a place like Khobar , just to be with me . Maybe it was envy that made me dig a little deeper : " So it 's been a good marriage -- no regrets ? " // She frowned and for a moment I thought I 'd offended her , but we 'd been intimate once , and she always was an honest woman . In a soft voice she said , " We have our differences , our problems ... every couple does , do n't they ? But no , I do n't have any regrets . " She would n't meet my eye , and we sat in silence , sipping our ersatz champagne . Finally she looked up . // " What about you , Steven ? What have you done for the past ten years ? What brought you back ? Especially now ? " // I knew it was coming , but I was temporarily saved by the arrival of dinner . The food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China it was meant to represent was debatable , but it was spicy and edible . I was hungry , and after a few mouthfuls I had my equilibrium back . " You remember , " I said , " what the boom was like here after the first Gulf war . When we first met . And how short it lasted . I made a lot of money selling mutual funds to expats , especially to Americans . After a year and a half , business began to dry up . In a couple of years it was over . " I took a long drink to kill the spice . I 'd finished the easy part . The hard part was next . // But I did n't have to tell it immediately . Sitting in sight of the door , I noticed two policemen walk in as if they owned the place ( if they 'd had a dime between them , they would n't have been cops ) and call the waiter . Saudi cops , like all Arab police , do n't have to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important how they look because everyone knows that what they say , goes , period . The waiter listened to them as he would to a judge handing down a sentence with no possibility of appeal . The police turned and left ( not without a lubricious sneer in our direction ; my bile rose and I wanted to wipe the sneers off their greasy faces ) . The waiter shuffled to our table . He gave an obsequious bow -- which could only mean bad news -- and told us that we had to leave immediately . He 'd be happy to pack up our dinner . // Helen argued : it was too early , the curfew was n't until nine . Until the waiter explained that it was a police order , an unexpected curfew , part of the crackdown on crime , on the remaining nightlife , on terrorism -- who knew ? // " If it 's a curfew , " I asked her , " where can we go ? Wo n't everything be closed ? " // " Shit , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , rhyming with " light " ) . " Yes , even the hotel lobbies will be cleared out . " // We stood there , hesitating , while the waiter packed up our dinner in back . The arbitrary orders had come down from above -- some colonel ? -- down the long Arab chain of command to the local cops on the beat , to our Indian waiter and finally to us . The orders were absolute and beyond question . Helen and I were powerless . It was like being the children of a capricious parent : a little taste of everyday Arab adult reality . // Our reunion was about to be truncated . I suspected it would be indiscreet for me to drive her back to her place , and I had nowhere in town for us to go . // Debt had forced me to head back to the Middle East at a time when nobody in their right mind was going there voluntarily . I 'd been living since my return in a Manama hotel room . Apart from a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person I knew on the Gulf . // It 's the most successful who take disappointment with the most equanimity , and I had n't been that successful for a while . I was n't ready to see the evening end yet . // I said , " Let 's cross the bridge . I 'll drive us both . We can catch up properly over a drink . I discovered a good bar . You 've probably heard of it : the Oasis . Or , we can just go to my hotel 's -- it 's not bad . I 'll get you home by eleven , midnight at the latest . There are n't any curfews in Bahrain . " // She looked distracted . " It would take us forty minutes to get across the causeway , and another twenty to your hotel . It 's too far , Steven , it would take too long . " // I wanted to get through to her , to connect ; I stepped closer , we were almost touching ; I could smell her perfume . Gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her skin was smooth and warm , like a memory of a life I 'd almost forgotten . I said , " We 've just begun to get reacquainted -- after how many years ? I want to spend a couple of hours with you . I want to know how you really are , how you 've been . Come on . Do n't let them win . Come with me. " // Different women show openness to intimacy in different ways . Some become wide-eyed and loud . Helen as a young woman would become quiet and conspiratorial . Irishwomen of her generation were not promiscuous ( like so much else , that must have changed ) , and I 'd been her first man . Even being taken for the first time she was quiet : holding back her cry , biting her thin lips , digging her nails into my shoulders . I hardly hoped now for her to give in , but she surprised me with a smile , close , almost secretive ; she leaned near and said : " I know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Aysen 's apartment . Silver Towers . " // She took me off guard , but it was a good idea . The apartment building was just around the corner . The ambience would n't be the same as a hotel bar but it would at least be private . It would certainly be more comfortable than the Royal Orient Chinese . " All right , " I said , " let 's go . " // " I still ca n't stay long , " she said , as if flirting with a second thought . // " We 'll stay just as long as you like . " // So we left the restaurant together in my car . // The sun slanted over the rooftops and the heat beat down on my rented white Toyota , on the garbage littering the potholed roads , and on the concrete and stucco peeling like rot off the shops and apartments . The scene reminded me of a Mexican border town I 'd once visited south of Tucson , with its cracked pavements , broken streets and suffocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full , knowing that it would just start kicking in as we arrived at our destination , the oldest high-rise in town . // They 'd started building two new towers nearby , but there 'd been some contractual or money trouble -- or perhaps the right prince had n't been paid off satisfactorily . In any case they loomed tall and half built , with their cranes standing dejectedly over them . Silver Towers , its sides clad in dusty fake marble , shone in the fading light . I parked in the dirt lot behind . We walked past a gang of skinny Arab kids in flapping thobes kicking an old ball , vying to knock over an empty Coca-Cola bottle in the middle of the road . // The two guards who used to sit at a table and record the names of visitors were gone . The foyer was empty . A heavy layer of dust and sand lay over the floor and over the drooping leaves of two potted palms . Palms can survive on very little water -- they prefer it dry -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevators was out of service : its doors gaped open to the empty shaft . // " Do you remember the floor ? " Helen asked me. // It had been a long time . " No , I don't. " // " The eleventh . Near the top -- thirteen in all . " She pressed the button and a cable shuddered ; the lights above the door blinked a descent . Thirteen was an unlucky number , but we would be two beneath it . " Are you certain the elevator 's safe ? " I said . // She laughed . " As safe as any of the lifts in Khobar . There are stairs , but I 'm afraid I 'm not up to eleven floors . " // " If it 's okay with you , it 's okay with me. " // We creaked slowly upward , then jolted to a halt . We stepped out . The corridor stretched north and south the length of the building , aligned with the coast , apartments on each side . At the far end a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in considering what kind of shape that would be in . A faint light filtered through the door 's grimy window , picking out the scarred tile floor and the scabby walls . I began to regret agreeing to come ; almost any bar in Manama would be better than this . " The place is falling to pieces , " I said . // " It 's been nearly empty for years . The last tenants , an Irish couple we knew , finally left a few weeks ago . No one wants to live in an unprotected apartment any longer . But they 're cheap , and Aysen 's is still in good shape . Come on . " She strode purposefully on , like a girl on an adventure . I felt like a character in a children 's novel , a detective story , or a story of hidden treasure : Helen was the brave girl leading me ( hanging back and doubtful ) through a dim cavern , to ... what ? My own true confessions , presumably . Something I 'd rather have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end -- I could smell her perfume as I followed her -- and she took out a key and opened the door on the left . She entered first ; I followed into an even darker hallway . She switched on a light . // An overhead fluorescent flickered , then lit up in garish relief the living room where Helen and I had first met at one of the hundreds of parties after the first Gulf war . Red afghan carpets lay strewn over the floor . A living room set of overstuffed beige furniture sat at convenient angles away from the walls , facing a glass-topped table . Smaller Indian tables of intricately carved dark wood supported Chinese vases and other artistic bric-a-brac . One particularly valued carpet hung from a wall ; two bookcases stood against another . There was a slight smell of dust . I recognized nothing from a decade earlier , but everything looked vaguely familiar : a mummified , preserved memory of a certain kind of comfortable , semi-artistic expat lifestyle in Saudi Arabia . // Helen threw her abaya over a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every month . It 's not bad , is it ? I do n't know how much is still here from your -- our -- day . Aysen redecorated a lot , but somehow everything always looked pretty much the same . " She slipped into the little kitchen , turned on a light and pulled open a cupboard . " Which would you like , " she asked me , " some sid , or some homemade wine ? I 'd advise the sid . " // Saudi is officially dry ; you ca n't buy liquor in public . It was yet another reason , besides security , for me to stay headquartered across the bridge in wet Bahrain . In Khobar you could , with the right connections , purchase home-brewed wine , or , if you needed something stronger : moonshine -- sid , short for the Arabic sidiq i : friend . Sid rotted your guts faster , but it was easier going down . I told her I 'd go with her recommendation , and crossed the living room to unlatch the sliding-glass doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass in each hand . // We stepped out . The balcony ran the length of the apartment . We had a bird's-eye view of the side of town facing the long desert toward Riyadh ; from the far end we could see the northern coast . Seen from above , Khobar looked even smaller : a little , down-at-heel Arab town on the southern shore of the Persian Gulf . None of the flashiness of the capital far inland . But this was where the oil , the wealth of the country , came from . // We walked to the end of the balcony and stared at the Meridien Hotel in the distance , a lonely landmark on the shore . The setting sun flashed on the hotel 's sign , and I saw that the giant M was askew , one of its moorings broken . // " Look , " I said , " remember how it hung crooked before , and how they fixed it , right after the first Gulf war ? Victory brought success . Business was roaring , everyone had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place now . I do n't get it . Oil 's been at record highs for years , but except for a couple of new malls outside of town , the place is dilapidated . " // " You 've been away so long . This is n't Abu Dhabi , or Dubai . The country was on a decline for twenty years , and the good times you remember , after the first war , did n't last . You remember that -- it 's why you left . In real terms , oil 's still lower now than it was twenty years ago . Sure , the royal family 's flush , but the average Saudi ... you do n't reverse thirty years of recession overnight . " I thought : She 's well informed ; it 's a plausible analysis . But she is the wife of a commerce officer . She continued , " This last war did n't bring us prosperity -- it brought us bombs in Riyadh , murders here in town , and hatred on the streets . You said on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " Saudis . Businessmen . They 've got the money , I 'm sure of it . They 're just not investing locally . I do n't blame them . I would n't either , in their shoes . They 're looking for somewhere safe , somewhere offshore . " It sounded like a sales pitch , even to me . But I believed it . // The sun was setting and we turned to the east ; the last rays lit her red hair like a halo of fire . She saw the way I looked at her , and said , " Let 's go in . Tell me about LA . " Back inside she took the sofa ; I sat on a chair opposite . It felt like an interrogation -- but friendly , without harsh lights or thumbscrews. // " You left me and Saudi , " she said levelly , " because the boom had run its course . You went back to California . And then ? " // I took a drink and a breath . " I 'd been good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The nineties were a great decade once they got started -- once Clinton got elected . Pretty soon I was a senior manager . I got married in ' 97 . " I looked down at my glass . It was too soon to take another drink . // " The firm got heavily into venture capital funding . I was a lead in opening that line of business , particularly with Silicon Valley start-ups . It was the height of the boom . Then the dot-bomb hit . Within a year our venture capital business collapsed . They brought me back into mutual funds , but by then everything was heading south . We were pretty aggressive trying to keep the company afloat ... maybe too aggressive . I was one of the last to go before it went under . I 'd been out of work for a while when the market finally picked up and I talked myself into this job . I sold them on the idea that there 's flight capital here , looking for a safe spot to fly . " // Translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a few good years ; the dot-bomb washed me up ; I 'm broke and I came back because it was the only job I could find . It was a summary that left out a lot , but I did n't feel that confessional . By a certain age most of us have periods in our life , and things that we 've done , that we 'd prefer to forget . I 'm an American . I believe in optimism . I believe in looking forward , not back . // Of course , you do n't always take all your old friends and acquaintances forward with you . If you confess a failure to a friend , and they look pained or embarrassed , it can be a proof of sincerity . But an attempt to hide a smile is a confession of envy : of your money , your job , your car -- maybe even your wife . // Helen looked compassionate . She said so softly I hardly heard her , more to herself than to me : " I remember now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking about someone from her past , but it was a compliment and I murmured my thanks . Then she said , " Returning to Saudi , especially now .... Did n't you have any doubts ? The security situation -- you must have kept up on it . " // " I did the research . The stats could be worse . The government signed on to the War on Terror . They 've rounded up hundreds of suspects . And they 're trying to liberalize : the local elections , for instance . Last year about ten Americans were killed or injured . With something like ten thousand of us left in the country that 's a point-one percent chance of anything happening -- at least to me . There have n't been any bombings on the coast for a couple of years . And I do n't even live here . I live in Bahrain ; I only drive over for business . So the odds , " I finished with a little grin , " are n't bad . " // She stared as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad joke . She said , " You 're mad . Completely mad . Steven , do you remember Westvillage -- the compound you used to live in ? " // I remembered . " Of course . " // " They cut the throats of four Americans there . Less than two years ago . How do you convert that to a statistic ? The threat 's real . And you ca n't predict when or where the next attack 's coming . I wonder how much you really know about this place -- or how much it 's changed . " // " I 've kept up . CNN , Fox News , the LA Times .... " // " CNN , Fox ? " Her eyebrows rose , then her voice . " That 's entertainment , not news -- and vulgar entertainment at that . You 'd do better to watch Irish dance . At least that 's real . Your American news shows have no idea what 's going on here -- or they 're not interested in reporting it . Or maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . I do n't think you know what 's going on here : the hatred , the politics . " // " Politics do n't interest me . I 'm here to make money , that 's all . " // " Politics is what this place is all about . It 's why we 're here . America considers this country its great regional ally . What is Saudi Arabia , really ? An absolute monarchy . A police state . A police state where probably forty percent of the youth are unemployed -- and , most of them , unemployable . The government 's pro-American , but the people , certainly the young , hate America . When the news of 9/11 hit the radio , car horns started honking . They loved it ! I doubt that made CNN or Fox , did it ? " // " Helen , I 'm not here to sell investments to the unemployed . I 'm dealing with businessmen . Responsible businessmen . Politics does n't enter into it . " // " Would the Arabs want to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hate -- if they thought it was safe to keep it in their own ? We 're all involved in politics , whether we like it or not . " // " Not me . I 'm not involved . " // " We all are . We live here . " // " I live across the causeway , remember ? I 'm not here to solve anyone 's problems -- except their investment problems . I 'm interested in local politics insofar as they stay favorable to outgoing investment . Other than that , I do n't give a damn . " // We 'd both become a little intense -- over what ? Something that was n't our business , that neither of us could do anything about . // She sat farther back on the deep sofa , farther from me , in silence . After a few moments she asked , " Are you working for an American firm ? " // " Yes . Winston Investments , in LA . A mutual fund company . " // " How does Harry fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me. " // " Your husband 's the local U.S. commercial officer : the bishop . I need his imprimatur. " // " What do you mean ? " // " The federal government 's scrutinizing funds leaving the Middle East , particularly funds from Saudi . All part of the War on Terror . I need Harry to vet my Saudi investors , at least the biggest ones . He needs to give them his blessing . And , of course , I 'm hoping he 'll be able to refer some clients . " // She said softly , " I thought it might be something like that . " Watching her , I recalled one of her mannerisms : she always looked troubled when giving bad news . // She said , " When you called this morning , I panicked . I asked you to dinner for a reason . I wanted to tell you that we could n't meet again , after tonight -- socially or any other way . It 's not that I do n't want to see you . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny town , and the expat community is so very small , much smaller than you remember . There are still a few people here from when we knew each other . We run into them at parties . I 'm married now , Steven . It may not be the happiest marriage in the world , but I value it . I do n't want anything , even a faint hint of an old rumor , to disturb it . I do n't want any rumors , even ancient ones , to reach Harry . You understand , do n't you ? " // Of course I understood . She 'd said she remembered my honesty , but I 've never believed in telling everything . Too much truth can be corrosive , even in the best marriage . I 'd never mentioned Helen to my wife . And in any case , what 's deader than a dead affair , a dead romance -- whatever you like to call it ? But with her sitting there , the memory of her taste still in my mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even resentment -- although I 'd had plenty of practice in keeping that in check . " I understand completely , " I said . " I 'll even find someone else to vet my Saudi clients . Someone at the embassy in Riyadh . " // Relief spread across her features , a relief so open and simple I could have been again with a girl too young to worry about who knew about an old affair ; a girl without the need to keep an older husband in the dark , to know what not to tell . She got up , stepped closer , knelt on one knee and put her hand on my arm . " I thought you 'd understand . I do n't want there to be any hard feelings -- and I 'm sure you do n't , either . Now do me a favor " -- her tone was that of a mother trying to cheer up her child after administering a mild rebuke -- " tell me about your wife . " // " My wife ? " The transition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentle approach . " We divorced shortly after I lost my job . " // She recoiled as if I 'd sworn at her . She said , " I 'm sorry . " // Silence fell between us . One can receive too much sympathy . Helen had given me the message for which she had set up our meeting , and I 'd given her the reassurance she wanted . Our reunion was over . I got up . " I 'd better be going , " I said , " and you have to get back to your compound . I can call you a taxi -- unless you 'd care for me to drive you ? " // She hesitated . " I 'm not sure you should .... " // " Of course not . I 'll call you a cab . " I looked around for a phone , but she exclaimed , " Oh , Christ , I can call one myself . " She took my arm , and said , " Let 's try and part friends . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and get some fresh air . " // So I went back out on the balcony , in the dark now , with the lights of Khobar burning beneath . They stretched up the coast to my right , and ahead to the desert 's edge , but on my left they stopped halfway to the horizon , as if a chunk had been bitten off the town 's perimeter . It was the air base . The Saudis like their security installations dark . // Helen joined me with our drinks , and asked , " Do you remember the parties Aysen used to have here ? " // I thought back . " Yes , I do . " // " They were so cosmopolitan . Turks , a smattering of Africans , Greeks ... do you remember Roberto , the Mexican ? " // " Yes , " I answered , and we both laughed at the memory . " We had a lot of fun . I met Aysen through investments . I 've forgotten how you got to know her . " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat trip -- you remember them -- the trips out on the Gulf ? She almost died of seasickness . I did what I could for her -- I was still a nurse , then -- and she never forgot . " // For a moment the years slipped away , and I was back in another kind of expat community : one of parties , friends , lovers ; one without fears , without worries , where a major crisis was -- a case of seasickness . " It was a good time , " I said . // " It was a grand time . " She stood beside me , staring down into the night . " I think I was in love with you . Do you remember ? " // " I 've never forgotten . " // " Why did n't you come back ? " She spoke into the night air . " Everyone -- including me -- thought you were returning . " // It was the question that had hovered unspoken all night . // She said , " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I did . Often . But you and this place ... it seemed like a dream . Like a place from a different planet , a different time . " Even in the darkness I could see her face had fallen . I never wanted to hurt her . I thought , There 's still time to sweeten it a bit -- and there 's truth in it , too . " I was a fool , " I told her . " I missed you . I had to make myself forget . " // " I missed you so much . " // She sounded on the verge of tears.It was an unlikely place for romance . But she was an affair from my past come alive again , and I 'd been so long without love . She wore honesty like a child 's innocence , without being aware of it . After what I 'd gone through in LA -- the business illegalities , the failed marriage -- her honesty was as sweet as her perfume , as the taste of her skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set my glass somewhat shakily on the balcony , placed my hands on her waist and drew her to me. // A warm breeze from the Gulf blew her hair into my face ; I brushed it aside with one hand , to reach her lips . For a second she yielded , but then pushed me away . She said , " You 're like a ghost , Steven . I wo n't be haunted . " // The flash far behind me lit her eyes . I turned in time to see a distant fireball on the edge of town vanish into the air like some piece of trick photography . I turned back to find Helen gripping the balcony railing . She looked vulnerable , and I felt the need to protect someone , to keep them happy -- like a pain I never expected to feel again . // The sound of the explosion was as faint as a sigh . A whisper of air from the shock wave ruffled the curtains . // " Jesus , " she said , " it 's the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in its direction , but there was nothing to be seen . It was too far ; everything was lost in darkness . // " What was it ? " I asked . // " Maybe an accident . Maybe a bomb . I 'll call the consulate . The duty officer will have heard something . " // We stood staring out at nothing for another minute , then I noticed that traffic at the base of our tower was increasing : cars were speeding toward us and turning in to park in the vacant lot opposite the rear of the building . A police car , with its lights flashing , sped up and joined them . No one was parking in any order . From the eleventh floor they looked as random as dice thrown into a box . // " What do you think 's going on ? " I said . // " I do n't know . They ca n't live here . The police are probably trying to find out . " But as we looked down , more cars , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a ragged convoy heading in our direction . In a few minutes the perimeter was clogged with vehicles . We had a confused picture of men moving beneath the streetlights toward the base of the building -- and vanishing inside . // " Could we be on fire ? " I seemed to be asking all the questions . // She gave a short , mirthless laugh . " That 's not the fire department . " She slipped past me into the living room and pulled a cell phone out of her purse . I lingered for another minute looking out over the balcony . Cars continued to arrive . Now they were having to park down the road . // " The consulate line 's busy , " she told me when I walked back in . " Why do n't you take a look at the lift . " // " What for ? " // " To see if anyone 's coming up . You can tell from the indicator lights . " // Her expression was calm but her posture rigid . We stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the corridor . It was empty and almost pitch-black . In order to see , I picked up a small vase and used it to prop open the apartment door . The elevator at the far end seemed very far away . // I saw the lights blinking on the panel on the wall before I was halfway there . The elevator was on its way up ; it had already reached the fourth floor . As I watched , the fifth light blinked on . The sixth blinked on , and stayed on . The elevator had stopped . // I looked around . Behind me was a door with a sign indicating a stairway . I pushed it open . In the gloom stairs led up and down from a landing . An obnoxious smell rose from the well . A dead cat , maybe , or a rat that had gotten lost and trapped . I let the door close and heard , faintly , the slap of cables . The lights blinked : the elevator was ascending again . Past the sixth , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started walking back to the apartment , keeping an eye over my shoulder on the indicator . // The eleventh light switched on , then winked off . The twelfth flashed , then the thirteenth . // In the living room Helen stood staring out the window . " Are they coming up ? " she asked . // " They 've gone past us . Right to the top -- the thirteenth floor . " // " Whoever ' they ' are . " // " Did you get through to the consulate ? " // " No , the line 's still busy . " // " Where did I put my drink ? " // She reached down and handed it to me . Our fingers touched . // " I 'm sorry , " I said , " about what happened out there ... I did n't mean to upset you . " // She just shook her head and punched in a number on her cell phone again . This time she got through . // " Bill , it 's Helen . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She listened for a minute , then told him where we were , and mentioned the crowd below and in the building . // " How should I know , " she said , " what the police are doing ? " And then , " Do you think it 's safe ? " A pause . " That 's almost certainly impossible . They 're all over the place . " Her voice fell : " They 're bound to see us . " After a moment she gave him her cell number , then hung up and turned to me . There was a slight tremor in her voice . // " That was the political officer . He said there 's a rumor that something 's happening at the air base . One or more explosions . He 's trying to find out , but he 's swamped with calls .

@@4022080 East Berlin , January 1963 // The five o'clock whistle shrilled , and Trudy pulled the lever to shut down the ancient , clattering loom . She had stood on cold concrete since seven that morning , and her legs felt numb and swollen . A persistent ache nagged her lower back . // On the next machine over , her friend Renate was using up the last of her yarns before quitting . If you were close to finishing a job , you were expected to complete it before leaving . Renate was pushing fifty , twenty years older than Trudy , but she never complained about the long hours or her aches and pains . Trudy made a sympathetic face at her , but Renate just shrugged . // When her loom was quiet , Trudy anchored the pattern cards and locked down the machine . All around her in the cavernous , high-windowed building , other machines fell silent one by one . The echo of their rattling bottled up her ears . A parade of unsmiling women crossed the factory floor in rubber-soled silence , too tired to talk . Trudy joined the queue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slot in the rack and left the building . // Outdoors , a greasy yellow light hung above the factory roof . The low sky smelled like diesel exhaust and possible snow . Trudy rolled her head in a slow circle and felt the burning between her shoulder blades , the crackling in her neck . She buttoned her coat and started the long walk home through gathering darkness . // Twelve weeks today . Stefan 's first birthday had come and gone , then Christmas and New Year 's . Twelve weeks since Rolf had gone across , and still she 'd heard nothing from him . Maybe Gisela had received some word from him today . She quickened her steps as if she had n't fed herself the same hope every evening . // Lights winked on in the buildings along her route.The pungent aroma of bratwurst and sauerkraut drifted out from an apartment house , and her stomach rumbled . She was always starving by the time she got home . But she was luckier than most of the women on her shift , who still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dinner ready , and her mother-in-law was a good cook.Trudy pulled her coat tighter and pictured Stefan at home in the warm apartment with his grandmother , waiting for her return . That vision sustained her during the long days at the textile mill . // A few months ago , Rolf would have been there waiting , as well . For a while after the wall went up and cut him off from his job in the western sector of the city , he was at home more than he had been in years . She 'd enjoyed those weeks , despite the financial hardship . But because he 'd been a Grenzgaenger-a border crosser who lived in the East but worked in the West for better pay-he 'd found it difficult to get a decent job in East Berlin . As the weeks dragged on , Rolf grew frustrated and bitter . Trudy had taken the factory job to get them by until he found something better . And Rolf had begun to spend hours away from home in other pursuits , dangerous ones that brought tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // It was fully dark by the time she climbed the stairs to their second-floor flat . Trudy insisted that Gisela keep the door locked when she and Stefan were alone . Trudy tapped three times before using her key . Behind the door Stefan shrieked , and she knew he was scrambling toward her on all fours , quick as a cat . He 'd started walking before Christmas , but he could still crawl faster . // Smiling , she stepped inside and scooped him up , covering his face with sloppy kisses . He giggled and squirmed , his dark curls falling away from his face , and then lifted his shirt so she could tickle his tummy . Was it possible he had grown just since this morning ? At this rate he 'd soon be too heavy for Mutti to lift . // Gisela called to her from her favorite chair , where her knitting was spread on her lap . " Hallo , meine Liebe . A long day ? " // Trudy carried Stefan and sank onto the sofa . " No longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful . Goulash ? " // " With boiled potatoes and green beans . It is ready when you are . " // " In a few minutes . " // Stefan slid off her lap and onto the floor , where he 'd left a pile of lettered blocks . Trudy slouched back on the sofa and watched the rhythm of Gisela 's knitting needles working blue-and-grey yarn . " What are you making ? " // " A cap and mittens for Stefan . I found an old sweater of Heinz 's in a drawer and unraveled the yarn . It 's pretty , ja ? " // " Yes , it is . " Mutti was a master at making do with what she had , a skill left over from the war in which her husband Heinz had died . // Tonight Gisela 's hands seemed tight on the needles , and Trudy noticed extra lines around her eyes . Either the arthritis had settled in her bad leg again , giving her pain , or something else was wrong . Trudy watched her a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ? " // The needles kept working and her voice betrayed no emotion . " I had a call from Wolfgang . " // Trudy frowned . " Wolfgang Krger ? " News from Rolf should come from one of his associates in the underground , not from the Volkspolizei. // " What other Wolfgang do we know ? " Gisela looped a double strand of yarn over the needles and took three quick stitches . The cap was starting to take shape , thick and warm . // " What did he say ? " // Gisela glanced up , and for a moment her fingers went still . " He wants to come visit us . He did n't say when . " // Trudy 's pulse jumped to her throat . This could n't be good . She had n't seen Wolfgang Krger in months , maybe longer , and she doubted Rolf had either . " Why ? " // Gisela shook her head and said nothing . She resumed her knitting . // Trudy saw in the set of Gisela 's jaw that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . Mutti was worried . She was also as stubborn as an old habit , and Trudy knew it was useless to question her further . // Gisela pushed the yarn back on the needles and folded her work into its faded canvas bag . " I 'll set dinner on now . I 'm sure you and Stefan are both hungry . " She pushed herself up from the chair and started for the kitchen . // Now that Rolf was gone , they rarely ate at the big dining table that anchored one end of the living room . The table was one of only two Hulst family heirlooms to survive the war . The other was the rocking chair Trudy used every night at Stefan 's bedtime . Tonight Gisela set out their meal on the small table in the kitchen . // There was little meat in the goulash , but Mutti was skillful with seasonings . Trudy held Stefan on her lap and let him eat small bites from her plate . She offered him a spoon but he preferred to use his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // She ate all of her goulash and took another half portion , but Mutti picked at her food and had little to say . Trudy listened to the ticking of the kitchen clock and the rhythmic kicking of Stefan 's foot against the table leg . She watched him track down green beans and gnash them happily with his three teeth . // When Stefan was full , he squirmed to get down . Trudy and Gisela cleared the table and stacked the dishes . While Trudy washed and Gisela dried , Stefan toddled around their legs , jabbering . His elbow was hooked around the neck of Bebe , the stuffed bear Rolf had given him not long before he left . The bear 's brown fur was already matted , the red tongue partly gone . // By the time they 'd finished , Stefan 's eyelids were heavy and he was starting to fuss . Trudy wiped him down with a warm cloth , changed him into pajamas and let Gisela kiss him goodnight . Then she carried him to the bedroom they shared . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its familiar song while Trudy 's feet pushed against the floor . All day in the cold clatter of the textile mill , she had looked forward to this quiet time . She hummed a Bavarian lullaby her mother had sung to her when she was small . Gisela had rocked Stefan 's father in the old chair , and Trudy hoped those memories would somehow pass to Stefan . She wanted him to have the kind of family history that she had lost in the war . // Stefan was her miracle baby , her first and last . The solid weight of him grounded her , and she was thrilled by the bright intelligence in his eyes . Even now , the perfection of his tiny hands left her breathless . // She laid her head back on the chair and closed her eyes . Stefan 's nose was stuffy and his breath rattled in his chest . Probably taking a cold . // A child 's life ought to be safe and happy . But she could n't even protect Stefan from catching cold or scraping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to children . Her own mother must have lain awake with the same worries , while Germany lunged toward war and Trudy 's father was drafted into Hitler 's army . // She had been six years old when her father went away , and now the same thing was happening to Stefan , even younger . The only image she had left of her father was a tall , straight man in a handsome uniform . His face had become a blur within a year after he was gone . How long would it take Stefan to forget Rolf ? Perhaps he already had . // Humming her mother 's lullaby , Trudy tried to remember her father 's face . She 'd been proud of him on the day he left , not even worried . Her father was invincible , and the grown-ups had talked about Hermann Goering 's promise that not a single enemy bomb would fall on the capital of the Reich . // The British RAF proved Goering wrong . The first time the sirens blared in the night , her mother had pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the bunkers near their home . Trudy had shivered in the damp cave , cradling the puppy her father had given her for her birthday . She clutched a blanket around them both , while her mother prayed and the night exploded . // That night the planes did little damage to Berlin . But that was only the first air raid , followed by many more . There were other dangers , too-looters in the bombed buildings and ruthless armed policemen in the streets . Worst of all , her friend Elsa Hammerstein disappeared along with her whole family , and no one would tell Trudy where they 'd gone . // Her father had come home only once , on leave . He was nervous and thin , and there were special ribbons pinned to his chest . His smile could not mask something sad and frightening behind his eyes .

" she whispered . // For a few seconds , he was quiet . " They would come and get me. " // " You could hide . " // His arm tightened around her and she looked up to see him smiling . // " No , " he said , and the smile faded . " They would find me . Besides , when a man 's country is at war , he must defend it . " // Then he looked at her in the way parents do when they 're thinking how fast their children have grown . Everyone had told her that lately , and her father had n't seen her for more than a year . // " You must help your mother all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . The war may last a long time , and it will be hard for everyone . Do what Mutti says and do n't complain . " // " I will , Vati. " // " I know you will . You 're a good girl . " He touched her face and smiled . " And you 're going to be as beautiful as Mutti . " // He left the next morning before daylight , and she never saw him again . Not even his body . // Stefan snored gently on her lap , his eyelashes a dark fringe against the ivory cheeks . Trudy kept rocking . She touched her fingertip to a sprinkle of cinnamon freckles across his nose , the only feature he 'd inherited from her . His eyes and mouth and chin were all his father's. // The father who 'd deserted them . // Trudy shivered in the warm room . Only when she was holding Stefan close was she brave enough to consider why she had n't heard from Rolf . Would n't a man who loved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he was all right ? Unless he 'd been caught . // She understood that he had to leave the East before he was arrested . She also knew this development was a direct result of choices he 'd made . Rolf had maintained a life apart from her since they 'd first met , when she was a new student at the university . He was two years ahead of her , studying art and history , but political activism was his true career . He had demonstrated against the Communists in the early 1950s and miraculously escaped arrest . // Rolf had rescued her from loneliness , and she loved him for that . She even loved his passion for his beliefs . But during the years of their marriage , the price for that passion was absence . It was Gisela who had held Trudy 's hand when she miscarried , and who had taken her to the hospital when her labor with Stefan began . On Stefan 's first birthday , Trudy had bought him a set of wooden blocks and Mutti borrowed enough sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end , she thought with some bitterness , politics was more important to Rolf than his wife and son . // On her lap , Stefan snuffled and his thumb found his mouth . Trudy told herself harshly to stop wallowing in the past . She was not the first woman to support a family and raise a child without his father . Stefan had become the center of her life , and she still had him and Mutti . // Gradually the knot in her chest loosened . She was almost dozing when she heard the light tapping sound , a knock on the front door . In the small apartment , no noise escaped attention . // She stopped rocking and heard Mutti 's uneven footsteps cross the living room floor . The door scraped open and she heard a man 's voice . Their conversation was a low hum , the words undistinguishable through the bedroom door , but she could tell Gisela had let the man in .

@@4022083 Lucy 's Last Hurrah // That winter there were two snowstorms . The first one was expected . Born in Florida and galvanized by the damp winds of the Pennsylvania mountains , it was strong as a wildcat by the time it reached upstate New York . The YMCA closed early and so did the library . The mayor declared a state of emergency , which it was . There were three head-on collisions on Route 19 and a teenager froze to death after falling into one of the gorges on the north end of town . Hank Stevens , who owned Hank 's Diner , could n't get out of his driveway and had to stay at home with his children . ( " No , " he said all afternoon . " Daddy can not go outside and build a fort . Daddy does n't own snow pants . " ) // Hank called Bill Kane , who made the soups and burgers at the diner , and told him to stay home . Bill had already assumed Hank would close the diner early because as far as he was concerned his boss was a lazy man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the diner anyway , because it was nicer than his own apartment , and called his ex-girlfriend Trish to see if she needed help shoveling or with anything , really . But when a man answered the phone , Bill hung up and went next door to Lucy 's Tavern -- which was never closed because Rita , the bartender , lived upstairs -- and got blind drunk instead . // The second storm blew in from nowhere a few weeks later , and no one , not even the weather girl on Channel 7 , saw it coming . The day started out clear , but by noon the air was heavy and raw , and by four o'clock the sky had turned steel gray . By five , as Hank Stevens , Bill Kane , and the other regulars filed into Lucy 's Tavern for happy hour , the snow began to fall . // At seven-thirty , Lucy Beech , the founder of Lucy 's Tavern , was awakened from the dream state she 'd been in and out of for several days . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madmen . She listened to the wind howling and it sounded familiar , like the melancholy cries of the wolves that used to greet her on the one hundred acres of woodland where she grew up in Alaska . That sound always made her feel at home , and now it seemed as if it was beckoning her , saying get up , come outside , come see this miraculous storm . // Lucy was eighty-two and her bones were tired , but she got out of bed and walked outside wearing only her nightgown and no shoes . Snow hit her face . Cold hurt her teeth . The fierce , bitter wind reminded her of the storms of her youth , and she sat down on a snowbank and waited . // Lucy 's obituary appeared several days later next to the police monitor , which reported three DWIs , one burglary , and an arrest of a woman whose cat was " defecating in an annoying manner " on her neighbor 's front porch . The obituary was short , as Lucy would have liked it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topeka and did n't know her very well . It hardly mentioned the tavern Lucy established , or how -- because Lucy loved live music and dancing and understood people who liked longing more than they did love -- it became the center of the community . // It did n't talk about Lucy 's late partner Suzanne , who died a month before Lucy and was buried in the garden by a slender birch . ( Like many women in that town , and perhaps the world over , Lucy fell in love with a handsome woman after years of loving men . ) Instead it mentioned Lucy 's fine hand at embroidery , her moral upbringing , and her decent sense of community service . // In its own way , the bar Lucy built did service the community . The place itself was nothing special -- a narrow room on the first floor of a brick building that had once been an apothecary . It had hardwood floors and mullioned windows , and when Lucy bought it , the floor-to-ceiling apothecary shelves and cabinets were still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter , which Lucy decided would make a good bar . She was in her twenties then , an Alaskan fisherwoman with proud cheekbones and long dark hair that she wore in two shiny braids . Rumor had it that she had been so skilled at fishing that she 'd once taught an orphaned bear cub to hunt salmon . But she 'd given that up to come east with her boyfriend , a noisy , failed actor who wanted to start a dance hall . They bought the storefront next to Hank 's Diner , and because it was mostly Lucy who paid for it they called it Lucy's. // Some people said the bar was cursed because Lucy 's boyfriend left town with a milliner six months later , leaving Lucy heartbroken and alone , miles away from the Northern lights and the midnight sun and all the things she used to love . But Lucy , who stayed in upstate New York -- a place known for its brutal winters and triumphant springs -- laughed at this . After all , even salmon swam upstream to spawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was as it should be , since people needed it to make them kind . // Over the years Lucy built her bar into an open front parlor full of music and drinking , where bad behavior within reason was perfectly acceptable . She knew how to use both the gun and the baseball bat she kept under the bar by the cash register and she did n't judge her patrons as long as they paid their bills . Although once or twice she may have offered her opinion . " You know , Martin , most of us learn in grade school that saying things like ' I 'm so lonely ' does n't impress women , " she might have said . And when Hank Stevens sat at the bar saying things about his wife like " You would n't complain about the smoke at a strip club the way she does , " she might have responded with , " I would if I was seven months pregnant . " To her , the bar was like a good wedding , where love , sex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone who breathed it in was drunk not just on booze but the smoky haze around them . // So , cursed or not , Lucy 's Tavern was the place most people in town came to lick their wounds or someone else 's , or to give in to the night and see what would happen . Lucy grew older and her body thickened . Her once nimble feet grew arthritic and gnarled as the roots of the poplars that lined the streets in the center of town . But her skin , which rarely saw the light of day , stayed youthful and high colored even as her dark braids turned gray , then white . The bar aged too -- the hardwood floors became seasoned and polished from dancing and fighting . The mirror grew mottled and reflected a softer , more flattering image of the people it faced . Eventually a gallery of stuffed birds -- a crow , a turkey , a proud kingfisher -- that Lucy 's partner Suzanne , an ornithologist , had collected appeared at the top of the bar . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since turned the bar over to her bartender , Rita . So none of her regulars knew she was quietly freezing to death that night , as they drifted in for happy hour and stayed out until dawn , taking shelter from the snow and the wind that shook the buildings . // Later , when they were at the bar toasting Lucy 's life , the regulars said she was in that wind , mingling with the smell of wood smoke and pine . They said she swept over the graveyards and apple orchards , on to Main Street , past the old brick row houses . They said they felt her make her way by Hank 's Diner , then by her bar , where she rode in on the icy air that came off of people 's jackets and lingered in the clouds of smoke and perfume . She might have been struck , as she often had been when she was running the place herself , by the rough and beautiful ways people carried their loneliness . She might have breathed into the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have said . The heart is right to cry . Oh , darlings , enjoy the night . She might have considered staying , at least until daybreak , but the wind picked up again and pulled her back into the storm . // The morning after the storm , the sun came out and the sky turned a brilliant blue . // " No , " Hank Stevens said to his children . " Daddy does not want to go outside . Daddy is going to make a ham sandwich , and then he is going to lie down . " // " This fucking town , " Bill Kane said , looking at his snow-covered driveway . " No wonder people kill themselves here every winter . " // It was Harlin Wilder , delivering Meals on Wheels as part of his community service , who found Lucy in her front yard in her nightgown , stiff and blue and dead , her face tilted upward , her hands tucked neatly beneath her thighs , as if she were waiting for something wonderful to happen . //

" ) , yes , some other traveler has left the Turquoise Guidebook in the top drawer of the white-painted dresser . Actually , all the furniture is white-painted in my room in the Htel Splendid , with the floor bare white terra cotta , the textured plaster of the walls painted white too ; there is a lurid green geometric-print spread that matches the lurid green geometric-print drapes . I like the clean and functional starkness of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turquoise Guidebook . Tunisia 's oldest Arab city and Islam 's fourth most holy city - after Mecca , Medina and Jerusalem - Kairouan is an exceptionally rewarding place . Its architectural interest is unrivaled and its strong eastern flavor is retained . Not surprisingly , it was divine inspiration that led to its founding , though , on the other hand , some European travelers later called it145an ' infernal site ' because of the climate . // Interesting , and I continue . In 670 , Oqba Ibn Nafi , advancing west , called a routine halt here with his army . A golden cup was found on the ground , which he recognized as one he had lost in Mecca ; then a spring was discovered , and declared to be connected to the holy well of Zem Zem at Mecca . Having first banished the ' noxious beasts and reptiles ' which reportedly had been present in abundance , Obqa founded his capital on the spot . Later , as the Aghlabid capital , Kairouan quickly developed into one of the world 's great cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship and influence , which reached far across the Islamic world , and . // But the commentary is starting to prove a slow go , so I skip a few paragraphs , try again : Although the Hafsids later made Tunis their capital , Kairouan has never lost its ancient holy status , with seven visits to Kairouan supposedly equivalent to one pilgrimage to Mecca . The town was jealously guarded from infidels and , before the arrival of the French , Christians needed a Beylical Permit to enter the walls ; and even then personal security was n't guaranteed . In 1835 , Sir Grenville Temple had such a permit , and he may have exaggerated in reporting that . // But that 's still a slow go . // I am reading while sitting in the white-painted chair at the whitepainted dresser/desk .

Back to the guidebook : Modern Kairouan is today a successful market centre for agricultural goods , especially apricots and almonds , and a major producer of carpets and Caravannes cigarettes . Through the post-independence years , its religious authorities periodically created friction over President Bourguiba 's attempts from the capital at Tunis for secular reforms . In 1960 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 327 ) , Kairouan pointedly . // But what 's the use , I 'd rather be walking about the city in the spirit of Paul Klee , who as a young man was so exhilarated on a trip to Kairouan that he apparently started shouting in the shadowy alleys winding through the souk markets of the Medina , with the prayers sounding and the bruised , purple-and-pink desert sky thick with starlings like pepper tossed to the wind , he bellowed to nobody in particular , " I am a painter ! " // Actually , even though it has n't happened , as said , I just as well get ahead of myself ( forget those earlier qualms about narrative momentum , that clunky metaphor of an unraveling giant ball of carpet yarn ) , and with the Turquoise Guidebook closed on the white-painted dresser/desk , I tell myself I 've had enough of that . Sitting there , I simply keep envisioning the slice of white panties of the woman whose name will turn out to be something like Daki , rather awkwardly lowering herself with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one leg and hoists herself up , to eventually stand on that wall . // With the disposable camera , of course , a yellow thing . I know that to be a fact . // Downstairs in the lobby a couple of days later I look around . I ask the creepy desk clerk about a restaurant he might recommend for the evening . He is slim and fawning , late middle-aged and looking too Westernized in the blazer and flannels and regimental-striped tie , all vaguely rumpled ; he has gray hair unevenly dyed brown and a nodding smile , talks in whispery French , laced with syrupy " monsieurs . " After some apologies on why the hotel 's own restaurant is not currently open for dinner , he recommends two places that he admits are only so-so , meaning it would be much better if the restaurant in the Htel Splendid itself were open . // Off the small but neat lobby there is a bar , though as with most bars in any Arab country like this I somehow know it will be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early evening will be drinking the one brand of local beer in the green bottles with a gold label . Nevertheless , I push open the door to the room that also has an entrance from the street and , of course , I see a lot of men in slacks and short-sleeved shirts , what passes for the local business attire , drinking the one brand of local beer in green bottles with a gold label ; a ceiling fan chuggingly axes away at the heat , the men all look at me as I stand in the door , and I let it close slowly again , returning to the lobby . ( This is somewhat different than the way it happened in a dream I had about this very bar . In the dream I do walk in , through the cigarette smoke clouding like yellow marble , and I head right up to the bar proper and order a gin-and-tonic ; it is drink that I used to order when I was younger and that my father , the courtroom judge there in Rhode Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cousin 's wedding possibly over in posh Newport , calling it a " ladies ' drink . " To make matters worse , in the dream all the men are looking at me as if I am pathetic indeed to order that ridiculously clear glass of quinine water and juniper-aromatic gin , with the wedge of lime and even a little candy-striped plastic straw sprouting , a concoction you probably ca n't even find in Tunisia , where hard liquor is a bit hard to " score , " true , these good-looking young Arab businessmen all seem to know that such is very much a " ladies ' drink . " To make matters still worse , I seem to have simply put on the first thing I could grab in my hotel room - all that white on white upstairs - and instead of stepping into my usual functional khakis with my usual long-sleeved chambray shirt , I seem to have stepped into a pair of melon-colored slacks that are skin-tight and only reach to the back of the calf ; they zip up on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I think , or Capri slacks . In the dream it takes me forever to finish the gin-and-tonic amidst all of those serious men who quietly seem to be trying to convince themselves that I am not there , that there does n't intrude into even their exotic Arab World anything as absurd as me ; nevertheless , out of some perverse resolve , I do take my sweet time with the gin-and-tonic , in those Capri slacks and chambray shirt , do finish it , right down to my performing a meticulous vacuuming of the remnants of the melted ice cubes on the bottom with the candy-striped straw . That was the dream of the bar . ) But having decided not to enter the bar now , in the lobby again , in this reality , I pass the obsequious , " monsieuring " clerk again , who , upon further consideration , now recommends one of the two restaurants he had mentioned over the other one suggested . He says it 's much better . // " Merci , merci , " I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Outside , it is the almost-eveningtime of Paul Klee , all right , that bruised sky , final prayers droningly floating from the loudspeakers of any one of the who knows how many dozens of mosques in what is today a small city like Kairouan , certainly no longer a major metropolis . I walk around the few blocks by the hotel , low stucco buildings always white and always with the traditional light blue wooden shutters , plus complicated balconies . At the Rond Point in front of the new post office , I see a bunch of open-front cheap rotisserie places where flames leap high in the coming darkness and where they serve chicken and chips ; the places look pretty bad . And suddenly , in a way , I am glad the hotel clerk gave me the names of the two restaurants that " monsieur " might try , the Sofra or the Sabra , both on Avenue de la Rpublique , a street I am now on but would n't be able to identify , because the street signs are , to repeat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placards were removed in a recent show of nationalism ; or perhaps in a city as traditional as Kairouan , as the Turquoise Guidebook emphasizes , the French names simply never existed , except on tourist maps or in the spiels of Westernized hotel clerks , like the creep at the Htel Splendid . Anyway , out of some very stubborn perversity I do n't want to go to the one he recommended - I think it was the Sabra - but on the other hand I 'm not sure exactly which one he recommended - it could have been the Sofra . I mean , one of those words could just as well be the other . When I do enter one place , empty , I can tell right away that I made the wrong choice , and it 's overpriced and dirty , with the gold cloth napkins set up in pyramids on the tables of the sizeable room , napkins washed probably after every four customers or so ; it 's a dump longing for class it does n't have . The mustached waiter himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , more exactly , it seems he knows I 'm an easy mark . Not wanting to make a mistake in ordering a local dish that I possibly might not like , Tunisian food being heavy on the red peppers and onions in oil , I opt for the roast chicken plate , which when it arrives seems no different than what I saw at those open-air places , right down to the soggy chips and the single fly the size of a bumblebee dueling with my own knife and fork for his share of the loot . ( And this too is somewhat different than the way it all appeared in a dream I had about this restaurant before I actually went there . In my dream , I am somehow with my ex-wife in this restaurant , with the same waiter and the same chicken and chips and the same , well , fly , in the singular . My ex-wife , the elegant dancer from a good Boston family herself , speaks in her raspily bored patrician accent that knocked me out when I first met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a place aspiring to class but not the real thing , is typical of me . And then she continues on , not touching her own plate of chicken , commenting casually that the food looks thoroughly disgusting , though she does tug on a loaf of the Tunisian bread , shaped like a flattened bowling ball , that is always good and that you can always rely on in any Tunisian restaurant . She says that my selecting this place was like my not ending up in the right kind of final club at Harvard . Not that she cared about final clubs back then , she being somebody who went right into full-time dance study in New York immediately after boarding school in Connecticut , but her brother , sort of a Golden Boy at Harvard , knew the pecking order . He was an aristocratic varsity hockey player , if that makes any sense ; like minor nobility , he spent most of his week during the off-season never at classes but sitting around Eliot House in a dressing robe or , in the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Porcellian , before the weekends spent driving his polished black Porsche coupe to pick up another date among the heart-breakingly beautiful girls from what at the time were two-year finishing schools in the rolling green Boston suburbs - places like Pine Manor or Bradford College , the girls being the variety of debutantes who became name models or bona fide name actresses or whatever . My ex-wife knows where I am vulnerable , needless to add , and when we were married she would never even refer to the club on Mount Auburn Street that I did manage to get elected to in my sophomore year by its name . Which is the exact same nonreference she perpetrates in the dream , as witnessed by the dodgy , mustached waiter , who seems to get a kick out of the fact that I 'm paying an outrageous price for the chicken and chips for my ex-wife and me - it would have cost no more than a couple of dinars over at the Rond Point by the new stucco post office - and my ex-wife , lithely beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touring with the company , she smiles , says : " What was the name of that final club you were in again ? What did they call it ? " True , my thinking I have found a good restaurant and ending up in a disaster like this seems to be just additional evidence of how pathetic my case in general is . The waiter interrupts to say something on the subject at hand , and , as it turns out , he had a close friend who was elected to a pretty good club at Harvard himself , in those days when the all-male clubs were ranked according to a definite , inarguable order of importance ; his friend apparently was n't in anything as exclusive as the airily top-of-the-heap Porcellian - there on Massachusetts Avenue above a men 's clothing store , with truck mirrors outside its windows so the Pore boys in well-tailored Brooks suits could sit in their leather easy chairs and watch the rabble pass by below on the busy sidewalk without ever having to show themselves at the windows to any outside gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of " Old Boston , " or the Spee Club , sort of daring in its including established-in-society Jews and Catholics , very solid , Jack Kennedy 's club , actually . ) Alone , eating the greasy , burnt chicken in the restaurant now , not in the dream , knowing I need food after having skipped lunch and I must masticate on a bit of this for basic nourishment , I keep repeating to myself , " Sabra or Sofra - what the fuck had that guy at the hotel said ? " But then I forget about that . // I tip the waiter too much , not wanting him to have the satisfaction of thinking that I know he had pulled one over on me and I was punishing him for it by not tipping him . // I think of what I will soon encounter , the white slice of Daki 's panties , to be specific , and I feel I still have at least one trump card left in my nervous mitts. // Do you see me ? // Or , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't even believe I am in Kairouan , the fourth holiest city in Islam . I 'm not ? Well , how do I know about details like the unwashed gold cloth napkins being set up like so many small pyramids there in the overcharging restaurant on Avenue de la Rpublique ? Or how do I know about the one brand of local beer having squat green bottles with a gold foil label ? Those are n't the kind of things you can look up in any Turquoise Guidebook or fish out of any simple dream . No , I am here all right , and I , myself , am more sure of that by the moment . // All of which is to say : // " Do you see me ? " // Oh , yeah , I see me all right . I am here . I am in Kairouan . I am in the fourth holiest city in Islam . And , to state once more : Now that the narrative progresses , I 'm definitely more sure of that than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later , I notice there is something that has been slipped under the door . It is a plain square white envelope , and I know right away that it is n't from the guy at the desk downstairs , because while it bears my name in black script , there is no smarmy " Monsieur " or even just an " M. " in front of my name . Inside is a small card , white and with more of the same script , saying in French ( I 'll loosely translate here ) something along the lines of a riddle : HOW CAN A BARBER NOT BE A BARBER ? // But I wo n't be fooled , and after showering under the tepid low-pressure trickle and then drying myself , thinking about it , also thinking about other things as I dress ( wow , is that a boil on my hip ? ) , I just pick up the guidebook from the white-painted dresser/desk and say to myself that it is n't even a decent riddle . I know exactly what the answer is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section on the sights of Kairouan . I now flip through the pages and confirm the solution : Following the main avenue to the west ( avenue de la Rpublique on most maps , though officially rue Ibn al Aghlab ) , you arrive at the Mosque of Sidi Sahab , or more correctly the Mausoleum of Abou Zammaa el Belaoui or Mosque of the Barber . Its occupant was a companion , or sahab , of the Prophet , and his distinguishing characteristic was that he always kept with him three hairs of the Prophet 's beard - one under his tongue , one on his right arm and one next to his heart , hence the tendency to call him the Prophet 's Barber . The mosque and its surrounding complex remain a much venerated place of pilgrimage , where families - both villagers and prosperous town dwellers - come to pay their respects . // I want to laugh to think , again , how lame the riddle is , an attempt at what you might call an anti-narrative force afoot , trying to deter me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the Mosque of the Barber , but the Grand Mosque , where I will see and meet the mahogany-haired Swedish woman ( I ca n't emphasize this enough ) hoisting herself up onto the low wall . Holding the yellow disposable camera . // Because this is the day that it will happen , I know . // I toss the card to the lurid green geometric-print bedspread , then pick it up again , crumple it , and toss it to the white-painted wicker wastebasket , assuring myself with satisfaction , " That 's better . " // I go downstairs to the deserted dining room and have the decent breakfast that comes with the price of the room , caf au lait and a full log of a split baguette with plenty of good sweet butter and tart plum jam provided , for what you call tartine . Nice . // After some errands around town ( faded , sun-warped postcards bought in the Medina , mailing them at the post office at the Rond Point , a few going to friends who have been dead for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room - the Red Sox baseball cap with the big red " B " on the blue twill of it to ward off the sun , and a liter mineral water bottle wrapped in a hotel towel in my light shoulder day pack to insulate it and keep it cool - setting out to view the Grand Mosque at last , there in the northernmost corner of the Medina 's walls , where I have n't explored yet . // Let 's be clear about this : Though many mosques in many cities are called locally the Grand Mosque , this one is certainly that - a grandest of Grand Mosques , one of the essentials of Arab World architecture , according to everything I 've read about it . It 's at that far , far end of the elongated Medina. // It is an especially beautiful morning , the aforementioned sky so clear and so forever blue in summer that you think , in fact , it is n't anything close to real , that somebody is putting you on . Yes , this was where Paul Klee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was later slaughtered in battle early in World War I , in France , and when Klee came to the Medina , which contained the entire city back then , golden-walled and smack in the middle of the scorched plains , he repeatedly wandered its twisted ways - the whitewashed buildings with frilled light blue trim , the domes of the half-dozen mosques therein sort of giant white mushrooms in themselves - and he said he no longer had to read A Thousand and One Nights because now he had been there ; he also proclaimed it was time to cease the foolishness of his rootlessness and return to Munich immediately and get down seriously to his own private vision , to become a real painter at last : i.e. , " I am a painter ! " // Everything dewily fresh , I pass through the first onion-shaped arch in those gold , crenellated walls at the South Gate , I walk the Medina 's main street of blue paving stones , newly woven fringe-edged carpets of that rare deepest-of-deep crimson hung everywhere . Rickety bicyclists jangle pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , another older , say " Bonjour monsieur . " The vendors are already stacking high the . the . until I catch myself , which you probably have done too , catching me , that is , and , of course , I already said that - and that particular walk through the Medina has already happened . However , now that I think of it , maybe it did n't happen that other time , when I was heading to the Office du Tourisme , but is happening now , when I am heading , very much so , to the Grand Mosque . // Or maybe it happened before it happened , because forget what I said about how it felt walking through the Medina earlier , because as with so much else in the shuffled pack of mirrors that passes for what we commonly call an existence ( hey , here 's a mirror card not with the usual Jack on it but with my twelve-year-old son who I never see much of anymore after the divorce ! hey , here 's a mirror card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern King ! ) , yes , like so much else , it certainly has all happened another time . // Anyway , I keep walking , veering off when I get to the old fortress , the Kasbah . Then towards the huge four-sided gold-stone minaret with a gold-stone dome on top , not the airy interpretation of a minaret that you sometimes see in books , such slim needles with dish-like tiers that are usually Ottoman : this mosque is more imposing and more intrinsically important than that because of a basic and ancient solidity . Construction on it started in 730 , when Kairouan was emerging as the major metropolis it once was , the giant conical pillars of the Grand Mosque 's central courtyard hauled by ox wagons - in some mythical feat of engineering in itself - from the temples in the ruins of the old Roman cities along the faraway Mediterranean coast . // Also , as it turns out , it is not morning at all , but a hot , hot afternoon , the smell of the dry dust of the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an aroma like vacuum cleaner innards , pleasant . As I get closer to the Grand Mosque itself , the bustle of the central Medina fades away , and when I am actually standing in front of the minaret tower of the ancient edifice , the mosque complex that makes for an island in the middle of a wide square surrounded by more of the Medina 's gold-stone crenellated walls , I am alone and feeling a little vertigo from the midafternoon heat . A sign on the front tells me in French that visiting hours are only in the morning , and now in the afternoon it is a time of prayer , visitors certainly not allowed . I back away a few steps from the hugeness of it , to look up as you do at a skyscraper - not that it is so dizzyingly tall , but it is so dizzyingly , well , massive . I take off the Red Sox cap and run my hand through my hair ( prematurely gray but not too bad in the thickness department for a guy my age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unzip it , and tug out the liter mineral water bottle that I had wrapped in the thick white terry towel embroidered with squiggly stitching on one end in green , " Htel Splendid " ; I twist off the blue plastic cap , to enjoy a long , tilting sip from the sweating bottle . ( Man , that wrapping-in-the-towel trick , I tell myself , could have been one of the half-dozen most truly sensible things I 've ever done in my life , and how cool the water is , how refreshing it is , as I almost picture my sun-shrunk flesh inflating back to normal dimension with the pure , sustaining hydration of it . ) I stroll around the perimeter of the building , into the dim shade on the far side where men are walking through a small green door to the courtyard and , beyond that , I suspect , the inner sanctum and the Salle de Prire , then I stroll back into the sunlight . There before the minaret again , alone in the square , I back up against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few feet high , affixed to the lofty wall of the Medina proper , which offers more of the welcoming shade . I thumb through the Turquoise Guidebook taken from the pack , then decide I 've had enough of that , and I slip it back in the pack and simply stare appreciatively at the gold-stone tower and its gold-stone dome ( I ca n't emphasize that gold enough ) ; the muffled chanting of afternoon prayers starts up like distant thunder from the Salle de Prire at the other end . // Which is when I notice a long , sleek buff-and-brown tour bus growling into the empty square , and without even sounding the air horn , the driver , invisible behind the tinted dark glass of the polished behemoth , just slowly pulls up beside the low wall to park , as I slowly and very reluctantly move down a dozen yards or so to get out of the way . The bus 's motor gargles softly , and when its doors wheeze open , a spill of tourists in beach gear - Bermuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files out , most of them not as much as glancing at the Mosque ; they are led by a guide directly to what I now notice are several carpet shops on the far side of the square . // I suppose my own concern at the moment is that the bus driver was so rude as to practically nudge me along as he parked . Also , I 'm not enamored with the idea that while thinking Kairouan was immune from the general tourist trade , there are , apparently , among the European suckers who fill those package-tours to new resort hotels in Sousse and environs on the Mediterranean Coast , some parties who are willing to endure the several-hour bus ride inland to end up here , invadingly , in sweetly unspoiled Kairouan , to buy carpets in the city famous not only for its ancient architecture but for the exquisite rugs as well . // And just when the bus appears to have emptied , a final passenger steps down the rubber-treaded chrome stairs . // She has short , bobbed , strikingly lustrous mahogany hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheekbones ; her eyes are icy blue . She 's a little pudgy , but her figure is noticeably good nevertheless , and she wears sandals and the kind of simple low-cut sundress , slate gray , that you might tug on over a bikini for a walk back from the beach , a lot of prettily pudgy cleavage revealed and the dress not much more than a mini in length . I 'd guess she 's mid-thirties. // She is tanned , to the point of being slightly burnt on the high cheekbones and the snub nose , and she has in her hands what is obviously a little yellow disposable camera , a thing made out of cardboard . Out of the bus , she looks around almost as if to check , it seems , that the others are gone , and after glancing up once at the minaret , she backs up to take a picture , the yellow box held to her squinting eye - though she soon realizes , it seems , that she ca n't take it all in , she has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // She examines the low wall , passes her hand over the ledge of it to test for dust , puts the camera on top , then first squats before she rises to lift one leg high , the sundress ' scant skirt riding up almost to her middle and then - from my angle , as she hoists herself like that - exactly what I have been waiting for . // The slice of the white panties there between her chunky tanned thighs . But I do n't mean just white , I mean the whiteness of all the thousands of square miles of the Arctic , or , better still , the Antarctic , where nobody ever has or ever will set foot , the white of all the pages of all the wonderful novel masterpieces not yet written , the white of all of the more than wonderful canvases waiting to be painted , true , that 's what kind of white it is. // The glimpse of it soon gone , she steadies herself up on her perch , then clicks the shot . // What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list in one of my dreamy notebooks . Look , it 's actually right here in a notebook ! And I guess I wonder if this spiral-bound stenographer 's notebook , brown cardboard covers , is the one I 'm supposed to use to research a magazine article ( I 'm still wondering : a literary article ? a political article ? a combination of the two ? ) , doing some real work at last and not weirdly fantasizing about a Swedish woman . Anyway , the notebook entries : My going over ( not going over ? ) to offer her a hand and help her step down again when she looks a little scared in the process , tee-teringly wondering if she should jump . Then our first talking ( not talking ? ) in French , until it becomes evident that I am American and she is Swedish , our laughing about that in English , and she says she refuses to go into any carpet shop , as she assures me that the package tour she is on has been driving her crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might stay in to spend a night here in Kairouan and not have return to Sousse in an hour with the group - she wants to see some of the sights of the legendary city properly , and surely she can take local transport the next afternoon back to Sousse . Then she fetches ( does n't fetch ? ) a slate-gray beach bag , which matches the slate-gray sundress , with some of her things from the bus , telling the sleazy driver - wearing aviator sunglasses , who certainly had designs on her himself - of her plan , I guess , then my assuring her that the Splendid is the best hotel in town , as I eventually help her book in there , with my stock rising in the eyes of the guy with dyed hair and the blazer and absolutely absurd regimental tie , everything suddenly indicating for me a prevailing ( how should we put this ? ) bull market indeed .

@@4022158 An exhilarating feeling took hold of Jake as he and KC , his ten-year-old golden retriever , wound down the curving , forest-canopied entrance to his cabin at Sandy Cove in the Minnesota North Woods . Large , mature oak and maple trees , still holding their fall leaves , lined the grassy half-mile access road with an occasional spruce tree accent . The final light of day barely captured the brilliant fall colors in the crisp air . His anticipation of arrival was like no other as the comfort of childhood memories created the familiar sense of well-being . // With his first glimpse of the cabin , however , Jake immediately knew something was wrong . The back door to the three-season porch stood wide open . It appeared stuck or jammed , allowing anything to come or go as it pleased . In thirty years , this had never happened . Oh , there had been the time when someone used the cabin to escape a winter storm for a few days , but for the door to be open like this-it made no sense . // The hair on the nape of KC 's neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate , the dog jumped from the Yukon and barked aggressively while moving toward the cabin . His hips were lowered and his front legs braced in a ready stance . His eyes focused suspiciously in anticipation of a hidden menace . // " KC , stay . " The years of training showed as KC immediately became motionless . // " Good boy , " Jake reinforced as he quickly clipped on the dog 's leash . Jake did n't know what to expect , but he sure did n't want KC running headlong into the cabin and trouble he could n't handle . // Jake pulled his shotgun from its case in the back of the truck and chambered three shells . Rather than approach the cabin directly , however , he circled . The cabin was situated one hundred feet from the lake on a two-acre clearing in the forest , giving Jake plenty of room to observe , but he was losing light rapidly . // He moved slowly . // KC continued to bark and tug at the leash . // Rounding the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door was open as well . He 'd been meticulous in closing up when he left in September , just two months ago . Besides , the Millers would have called if something serious had occurred-and if not them , then someone else . The few people who lived on Arrowhead Peninsula were always looking out for each other , making sure that damage from weather or vandalism did n't get worse by going unchecked . // As Jake and KC approached the open lakeside door , a big gray squirrel ran from inside the cabin across the wooden deck . // " Terrific ! " he murmured under his breath . While squirrels were the least of his worries , he knew this was not a good sign . // Moving closer to the elevated cedar deck , Jake called out , " Is anybody here ? " // No answer . // By now it was almost dark and the shadows of an emerging moon low on the horizon made it difficult to see inside the cabin . // Jake decided to take KC back to the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hands on the shotgun .

" The dog responded immediately and jumped back into the cargo area of the truck . // " I 'll be back in a minute , boy . I want to check this out by myself . You 'll be okay . " // New batteries for his big flashlight were on tomorrow 's shopping list . He tried anyway . Click . Dead , just as he thought . // Jake walked back around to the lake side of the cabin under the remaining light from the water 's reflections . Visibility was marginal . // Quietly , he moved closer . He detected a rotten aroma but could not clearly identify the smell . Stale garbage , maybe ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if someone or something had ripped through it . // This is not good , he thought . // Once he was on the deck , the stench became overwhelming . Peering inside , Jake saw the living area in total shambles . The place had been ravaged , but there was more . The sickening smell came from rotting parts of a deer carcass , partially eaten and strewn across the floor . // " Aw , shit ! " He repositioned himself to get a better look . // " How could this happen ? " // His heart left him when he heard bobcat-like growls from the upstairs loft . Two large raccoons lurked in the deep shadows at the top edge of the stairs leading to the bedrooms . Jake knew they were harmless so long as he stayed out of reach . But raccoons would attack and do severe damage to a dog , even one KC 's size . He regarded his decision to kennel KC as a good one . // Jake backed away and reached for the wall switch . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The raccoons and squirrels might account for some of the damage , but not for the chaos that lay before him . The deer carcass and its grotesquely disjointed parts looked like an insane massacre had taken place . // Staying clear of the raccoons , Jake cautiously checked the rest of the cabin , praying for no more surprises . He found none . // He knew the raccoons must be evicted tonight . Locking the doors with them inside would only create panic and inevitably more damage . Leaving the doors open in the hope they would leave would be just plain stupid . He had to get them out now , he thought , and tackle the bulk of the cleanup tomorrow . Other than removing the remains of the deer carcass , there was little else he wanted to do tonight . // He remembered a trick using gasoline , rags , and a pole and started toward the garage . He would gas the rag , stick it on a long pole , and jam the pole into the raccoons ' faces-a sure formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabin by about forty feet , the garage stood in the darkest shadows of the yard near the forest . Jake laid down the shotgun and tried the door handle . It was locked , a good sign . He pushed inward after unlocking the door , but it was impossible to see anything . The garage had never been wired for electricity , and Jake had become used to fumbling for things he needed in the dark . The noticeable smell of mice droppings permeated the air . Mice seemed to prefer the garage to the cabin for their winter stay . // Jake knew the gas can sat in the far-right corner of the garage just as he knew his socks were in his bedroom chest of drawers , second drawer on the left . Things had their place in his world . The rags lay on the workbench to his left . Several long poles were propped near the side garage door . Jake groped his way across the garage in a **26;862;TOOLONG fashion , both hands straight out in front of him . The garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes of household items infrequently used , various tools and equipment and a disassembled Hobie Cat . Airtight containers for food and bedding were on several metal tables out of reach of the mice . Better go slow , he thought , do n't want more of a mess . // Extending electricity to the garage was one of those projects that never got done . Minnesota summer nights never got really dark until about ten o'clock or so . Late fall and winter were different . It was barely six o'clock and completely dark in the garage . The priority of this project would have to be moved up , he thought . // With his mind and extended hands focused on successfully navigating to the gasoline can , his face ran straight into something heavy and soft . // " What the hell , " he said , as his hands instinctively rose to protect himself . // Surprise escalated to horror in an instant when his hands felt the legs of a body-a human body ! He stumbled backward , nearly losing his balance , knocking tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once outside , he ran to the cabin to get the kerosene lantern off the fireplace mantel , his mind whirling from the chain of events . He avoided the raccoons , retrieved the lantern and matches , and returned quickly to the garage . He struck match after match , trying to light the lantern with shaking hands . Finally the mantels lit and a cascade of light flooded the garage . // " Oh my God ! " Jake cried out as he saw the man , an Indian , hanging from the rafters . Stunned , he cautiously moved closer . // He did not recognize the corpse . Was this a murder or a suicide ? Whatever it was , it had to be recent . The body had no smell of decay . He remembered only the scent of the mouse droppings when he opened the garage . What is going on ? Who is responsible for this ? Questions raced through Jake 's head . // Reaching for the man 's wrist , Jake tried to get a pulse ; there was none . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck offered further proof that he was dead . Jake touched nothing else as he got the gasoline , rags , and poles from the garage . He would call the police from the cabin and then deal with the raccoons. // * * * // After several rings , an officer answered . " Chippewa Lake Police Station . " // " Officer , my name is Jake Lorenz and I want to report a dead man in my cabin . " Jake 's voice shook . // " This is Sheriff Betts you 're talking to . Slow down . Tell me first , are you in any immediate danger ? " // " No , I 'm not . " // " As near as you can tell me , do you expect to be in any danger ? " // " No , I do n't think so , but I really do n't know . I do have a loaded shotgun if I need it . " He recognized the potential consequences of the sheriff 's comment . // " Is there anyone else there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his speech , encouraging Jake by example to slow down . // " No , I 'm here alone with my dog . We just arrived at my cabin and found this guy hanging from my garage rafters . " // " Did you say hanging ? " // " Yes . " // " We 'll have a car there as fast as we can . What 's the fire ID number ? " // " 84B. " // Without an address or a mailbox , the fire code was required on all driveways for emergencies . It would be easy to spot with only one road leading onto the peninsula . The sheriff said he would be there in less than thirty minutes . // While waiting , Jake went about the task of evicting the raccoons . The first left quickly , but the second was cornered under a chest of drawers in the upstairs bedroom . It hissed viciously as Jake approached . The room was small , making the long pole awkward to handle . Finally , he was able to position the gasoline rag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coat bristled in defense as it flashed its razor-sharp teeth . Jake was closer than he wanted , but thankfully the raccoon chose to oblige his efforts by leaving . Deciding that it would be wise not to move anything in the cabin , Jake closed the lakeside door , opened some windows for ventilation , and left everything else the way he had found it . // As he walked around the cabin to the open windows on the three-season porch , he noticed something completely out of order . The hold-open washer on the pneumatic door-closing mechanism had been set to keep the screen door open . // " Why would someone do this ? " // Jake had no enemies , but this destruction and the death of that poor Indian were certainly premeditated . He was beyond bewilderment . // * * * // " This is no suicide , " Sheriff Betts said after taking his time to survey the scene . " Our local Indians can be very self-destructive , but they never commit suicide like this . Drugs , alcohol , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this man was clubbed from behind , " he said , pointing to the blood and matted hair on the man 's skull . " Nope , this man was murdered . " // Chapter Two Jake decided to head back to Chippewa Lake once the body was removed and Sheriff Betts had completed his initial investigation . The police work had done little more than confirm what Jake already knew and darkness had prevented a detailed search of the crime scene . The sheriff posted a deputy until they could get a better look in the morning . // Jake 's thought was to stay at the small motel on the bypass of Chippewa Lake . It was a bit of a dump and as far as he knew it did a better hourly business with locals than overnight business with travelers . Considering the circumstances , it would have to do ; there were no other choices . He needed to collect himself . The stress of the events and concern for that poor Indian had him pretty unraveled . He remembered the sheriff had mentioned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? His heart ached . // On his way to the motel , Jake decided he 'd better stop at Bud and Helen Miller 's . Bud and Helen had lived on Arrowhead for thirty-five years , moving from Chicago after Bud 's liquor store was robbed and he was beaten for the third time . Bud earned a living as an electrical contractor and handyman for the area , and Helen was a part-time cook at the Cedar Lodge and Fishing Resort nearby . Their longstanding friendship with Jake 's parents led them to becoming informal caretakers of Sandy Cove over the years . Bud opened and closed the cabin in the spring and fall and handled some of the small projects Jake could n't quite get to . Helen looked after the few renters the cabin occasionally had . She checked them in , making sure they had what they needed , and cleaned the cabin for the next arrival after they left . Bud and Helen generally made it a point to look in on the cabin from time to time for potential problems . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the need to alert them to what had happened . // The area floodlight at the peak of the garage provided a shadowed image of their weathered , log-sided home as he entered their driveway . KC started moving around , sensing that they were stopping again . // " Go on , boy , but do n't run off , " Jake said , letting KC out to snoop . KC was familiar with the Miller 's house and yard and would likely find Blackie , the Miller 's dog , outside . Jake walked the twenty feet to the front door and knocked . // " Well , if it is n't Jake Lorenz . This is a surprise , " Helen said , smiling as she opened the door . " I heard your car in the driveway , but did n't expect you so soon . " // " Buddy , " she called out . There was no answer . " Buddy , " she called out even louder , " Look who 's here . " // Buddy 's response was somewhat muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in the bathroom . I 'll be out in a minute . " Helen 's persistence in calling her husband " Buddy " added to Jake 's amusement . He knew that Bud hated the nickname because of the way Helen accented the second syllable . // " You know , Jake , it seems like men have some kind of spiritual relationship with the bathroom . If it was n't for that bathroom I do n't think Buddy would read at all . But why am I bothering you with all this ? Come in and sit down while I get you some coffee . Do you still drink it black ? " // " Thanks , Helen , I do . " But before she could turn around , Jake gave her a big hug , just like he always did when he saw her . Her stout , overweight physique was quite a handful . In reality , he had n't known Helen and Bud well for very long , but they were friends nonetheless . Maybe it was the closeness they had with his parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good to see you too . " Helen adjusted her thick , gray wig from the shift made by Jake 's embrace and smiled a crooked half-grin in a self-conscious response . // " You said you were coming for the winter , but I 'm still a little surprised . Come to think of it , this is the first time anyone from your family will stay at the cabin after October . Your mom and dad sure didn't. " // Bud entered the kitchen from the hallway while still tucking in his washed-out flannel shirt . His wiry build demonstrated his attention to his health and the bounce in his walk spoke of a positive attitude . // He and Jake shook hands heartily . // Jake respected Bud for being able to pick up stakes after the problems in Chicago and start a new life on the peninsula . Even though the early 1960s were n't like the days of real homesteading , Arrowhead was still off the beaten path and much less settled then . Only the Stenway family had owned property on the peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to your stay here this winter , Jake , " Bud said . " You 're going to find out that the winter is completely different-more so than you 'll ever imagine . It 's my bet that you 'll like it a lot . " // " I think you 're right , Bud , but I 've got to tell you it 's starting off on a real downer . I want you to listen to something unbelievable . " His sober expression was very noticeable as he sat down at the kitchen table with his cup of coffee . // " A man 's been murdered at the cabin ... " // " What ! " // " An Indian-the sheriff said his name was Smith . Beaten and hanged by a rope from the garage rafters . " // ( Continues ... ) // 
@@4022162 " December 7 , 1941 : The day the world changed forever . " // James Rhodes- " Rhodey , " as his friends called him-was seated to the right of a large screen , mounted on a wall behind a podium . He acted as if being on stage was the most comfortable and natural thing in the world for him , rather than being what it was : incredibly nerve-racking . But Rhodey was far too accomplished a military man to let any display of nerves be evident . Besides , someone who had faced enemy fire should be able to deal with this stupid fear he had about public speaking . Still , he would have felt a little more comfortable if at least a couple of people in the audience were aiming weapons at him . // He was at the front of a huge ballroom , one of the larger meeting facilities in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas . The lighting in the room was dimmed , with the recorded voice of a narrator who sounded suspiciously like James Earl Jones coming through the PA system . There were about a hundred people seated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinners being collected by waiters and waitresses . On the screen was footage of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt seated in front of a radio microphone , delivering quite possibly the most famous radio address in history . The narrator continued portentously , " President Roosevelt declares the United States will build fifty thousand planes to fight the armies of Hirohito and Hitler . . . " // The image on the screen shifted . Invading Nazis were goose-stepping their way through the streets of Paris . // " Although no such capacity to build existed , Howard Stark , founder of the fledgling Stark Industries , answers his call to duty . " // The screen depicted a hangar in a small rural airfield . The landing strip that was visible was barely more than a dirt road . The words " Los Angeles " were superimposed over the picture just to establish a place . A man dressed in a 1940s-style suit was standing proudly in front of the hangar , arms akimbo . He had a pencil thin mustache and was wearing a fedora pushed back on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read " Stark Industries . " // " . . . and builds not fifty , but a hundred thousand planes . " // Howard Stark , grinning ear to ear , was standing in the Oval Office . He was shaking hands with FDR . He looked like the happiest man in the world . FDR looked as if he were working to keep the smile on his face ; perhaps , Rhodey thought , he 'd just had an argument with Eleanor . // The image on the screen returned to Stark Industries , and it was obvious that time had passed . The forest that had been visible in the background was gone , razed to the ground . In its place was a row of hangars rather than the one , and the name " Stark " was spelled out via huge raised letters atop the hangars , like the " Hollywood " sign . The small , unimpressive runway had been replaced by smooth , endless vistas of concrete . It was a genuine airfield rather than just some small start-up endeavor , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were rolling forward , gleaming in the sun , ready to fight for democracy around the world and-ideally-bomb Hitler and Hiro back to the Stone Age . // The image of them on the ground dissolved to the bombers in flight . This was not promotional footage taken by Stark Industries back in the day ; this was newsreel footage , showing Stark bombers airborne . Their versatility in battle was clearly depicted as some of them were shown dropping bombs while others were spitting out paratroopers , cracking silk and descending upon the enemy . // All of them old men now , Rhodey thought as he saw young examples of the Greatest Generation hurling themselves into combat . Old men or young dead men , immortalized on film . // A mushroom cloud erupted in a New Mexico desert . The narrator said , " Later , Stark 's work on the Manhattan Project makes the end of the war possible . " There was Howard Stark again , observing the explosion alongside Robert Oppenheimer . One hoped that they were a sufficient distance to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , that might go a long way toward explaining Tony , he thought , and then decided that that was a rather uncharitable attitude to have . Certainly it was unworthy of an Air Force officer . // " Stark Industries would go on to contribute to every major weapons system through the Cold War . " The visuals were now coming so quickly that they were almost a blur . The mind 's eye barely had time to register B-52s , ICBMs , nuclear subs gliding through the ocean , F-16s launching from carriers . A series of presidents flew by : Harry Truman , Dwight Eisenhower , John F. Kennedy , Lyndon Johnson , Richard Nixon . And next to every one of them was Howard Stark . It almost reminded Rhodey of that Woody Allen film , Zelig , in which the actor/ director was visually inserted into great moments of history . The difference , of course , was that Howard Stark was really there . // " But Howard Stark 's greatest achievement would come in 1973 with the birth of his son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the possible James Earl Jones . There was President Gerald Ford , standing next to Howard Stark while cradling baby Tony . Howard Stark was looking slightly nervous ; perhaps he was concerned that Ford , who occasionally garnered a reputation for clumsiness , might drop the infant . Moments later , as years subjectively whizzed by , four-year-old Tony was shown building a massive city entirely of blocks . Already one could see the gleam of determination and the excitement of discovery in his eyes . And then , just like that , Tony Stark was twelve years old , working alongside Howard to assemble a hot rod engine . A gleaming-red hot rod , the obvious eventual recipient of the engine , was visible in the background with its hood open . // " From early on , it was clear that Tony Stark had a unique gift . At seventeen he graduated at the top of his class from MIT. " // Tony Stark , looking unconscionably young , was shown in a hangar full of F-18s . He was climbing around inside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement . // " Four years later , tragedy would pass the Stark mantle from father to son , " said the narrator . At Howard Stark 's funeral , Tony was shown alongside presidents both past and present . " The loss of a titan . But Tony did not let personal grief distract him from his duty . At twenty-one , he became the youngest-ever CEO of a Fortune 500 company . " // Tony was shown cutting the ribbon on a brand-new Arc reactor at Stark Industries West Coast headquarters . He was smiling , posing effortlessly for cameras . The difference between father and son was instantly evident . Whereas Howard Stark was stiff , even slightly uncomfortable on camera , making an effort to look at ease and not quite succeeding , Tony Stark was born to have a lens aimed in his direction . His body language was relaxed , his smile so perfect that Rhodey wondered if he did n't practice it in the mirror . // " And with it came a new mandate : smarter weapons . Fewer casualties . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shown hitting its target with a precision that previous generations of missiles could not even begin to achieve . Other examples of Stark weaponry flashed across the screen , a visual cascade of America 's modern military might . Rhodey 's voice became louder , building toward the climax of the presentation . " Today Tony Stark 's ingenuity continues to protect freedom and American interests around the globe . " // When Rhodey had seen the next visual in advance , he had winced inwardly . He had thought it was , frankly , a bit much . But Tony Stark had sat next to him , viewing the video when it had first been cut together , and personally approved the image that was now on the screen : a waving American flag superimposed with an Annie Liebovitz portrait of Tony . // The crowd , somewhat to Rhodey 's surprise , cheered in approval . Well , Stark had been right when he made that call , obviously . Nothing stirred a room full of top corporate executives and movers and shakers who were thriving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an in-your-face symbol of the American way of life . // As the image on the screen faded out , the applause continued to swell . A light shined down on Rhodey , who blinked uncomfortably against the glare but tried to take it in stride . " As program manager and liaison to Stark Industries , I 've had the honor of serving with a real patriot , a man whose life has been dedicated to protecting our troops on the front lines , " said Rhodey . " He 's a friend and a great mentor . A man who has always been there for his friends and his country . Ladies and gentlemen , this year 's Apogee Award winner , Mr. Tony Stark . " // Rhodey would n't have thought it possible , but the applause actually kicked up a few notches . A spotlight swept across the darkened room and came to rest on Tony Stark 's chair . // Unfortunately , Tony Stark was not occupying it . // The applause slowly trailed off and the lights began to come up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupants of the room . Rhodey felt his stomach clench , as it typically did when Tony Stark did something pigheaded. // A figure was making its way up toward the podium now . Rhodey squinted to make out who it was , and realized that it was Obadiah Stane . Stane , the chief financial officer of Stark Industries , was clearly about to try to do some damage control . // Stane had a shaved head and a salt-and-pepper beard that made him look older than he was , but he never seemed to mind . He was also one of the most personable people that Rhodey had ever met . Very little seemed to throw him off his game ; he was , to use an overused word , unflappable . Rhodey supposed that when one had to deal with Tony Stark on a daily basis , it was either cultivate that attitude or lose one 's mind . Stane had obviously opted for the former . // " Thank you , " said Stane , as if the audience was expecting him and genuinely pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Tony Stark , but if I were Tony , I 'd tell you how honored I am and . . . what a joy it is to receive this award .

Our immediate and potent connection seemed so natural and effortless that it must have been preordained. // Of course , now I realize it was a tad more complicated than that . I was fairly sure he 'd seen me somewhere prior , and I often wondered if he had n't been following me and become obsessed , but I never stumbled on any evidence to prove how it had happened . // He was the most organized , meticulous person I 'd ever known . Nothing with him was random or haphazard , so it was difficult to decipher his motives . Very likely , he 'd schemed for months to arrange bumping into me , but the notion of it having been so calculated was too sinister , so I forced myself to believe it had all been chance . // I was vacationing on the Oregon coast with my boyfriend , Steve . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had sex-an event I scarcely remembered , but which he recalled fondly . // We lived together in a dumpy but cozy apartment in Portland . Steve worked as a salesman in his dad 's restaurant supply company , while I was employed at the upscale Mozart 's restaurant , where I was a dessert chef . // I was twenty-three years old , and I had been in the city long enough for my acquaintances to decide I was a true Oregonian . With my passion for expensive coffee and exotic food , my brown hair with its spiky blond highlights , my clunky jewelry and trendy black wardrobe , I was too typical to be an outsider . // I rode the train and pedaled my bike rather than driving a car , although this was a financial choice and not an environmental one .

The rain came down in torrents , wind gusts shaking everything so violently that part of the cottage 's roof blew off during the night . // Though our apartment was only two hours from the beach , I had never visited before that disturbing day , so I was n't prepared for how awful the weather would be . In Portland , it drizzled politely . On the coast , it was an unrelenting , tempestuous deluge . // Steve and I had been trapped inside for nearly twenty-four hours , and we 'd started to go stir crazy . // We spent the morning in bed , having sex and coffee , but we could only copulate so many times , and we were anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots , so after lunch we donned them and ventured down the stairs that led to the sand . The scenery was fantastic , what we could see of it anyway , with towering cliffs and slamming surf . // We lasted about ten minutes , then we were soaked , and we headed back to our room . We read books , we played checkers , and we watched television until the electricity flickered out . Initially it was romantic to sit by the fire , but by evening the thrill was gone , and Steve was pacing like a tiger in a cage . // The front desk gave us directions to a restaurant and bar just through the trees , so we bundled up and trudged over , hoping to dine , then quench our boredom with cocktails . Luckily the restaurant was open but serving a limited menu due to the power outage .

It would add an aura of mystery and excitement to an otherwise dreary adventure . // The woman was glamorous , like a fashion model , with long , curling blond hair that probably was n't her natural color .

They were too magnificent to be in the same establishment with us , and I kept sneaking peeks at them , curious as to what had spurred them to brave the storm and follow us in. // The woman seemed to be our age , mid-twenties , but the man was older-maybe mid-thirties or forty-and I could n't take my eyes off him .

My nipples were so inflamed that if he 'd slithered up and stroked one of them , I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loitering in a public corridor , allowing him to grope me ? I had no idea . // " What 's your name ? " he inquired . // " Meg. " // " Meg . Hmm . " He pondered it , then nodded as if that 's what he would have picked for me , as if he deemed it to be absolutely right . " How old are you ? " // " Twenty-three . " // " You 're very pretty . " // The compliment broke whatever weird magnet held us together . I 'd been called many things in my life : interesting , exotic , different , but never pretty . Not even by Steve , and to my ears it sounded contrived , another come-on. // " Thanks . " I chuckled , spun , and walked away . // I did n't glance around to see if he was following me , but I was positive he was . I could feel his hot gaze on me like a brand , as if he had X-ray vision . The sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveled in it , a small , vain part of me tickled that he was intrigued enough to stare . // In the bar , I was n't surprised to discover that while I was off flirting-or whatever it had been-with a stranger , Steve had struck up a conversation with the blond goddess . He was a salesman , so he had a gift for gab , which was the reason he was so good at his job . He genuinely liked people , had tons of friends , and in a situation where I would be too shy to speak , he 'd already have learned everybody 's address , phone number , where they 'd gone to school , and their employment history . // I was relieved that he had n't moved to her table , that they were still sitting where I 'd left them . They talked as if they were old chums , and they were discussing French painters of all things , about which Steve knew nothing , but he was a bullshit artist so he easily carried his share of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking about my encounter in the hall and how it had rattled me . Eventually , the dark-haired man returned and slid in next to the blond . He sipped his drink , too . We gaped at each other as Steve and the woman continued to chat , but they were totally absorbed and unaware that the man and I were having our own little drama . // I tried my best to avoid eye contact with him . I studied the ceiling , my reflection in the window , the bartender washing glasses . Whenever I peered straight ahead , the man was observing me with such a determined gleam of appreciation that I wanted to leap up and shout , What ? What are you looking at ? // But I did n't . I did n't care to have Steve realize that the guy was watching me , or that I was watching him back . // He whispered to his companion , and whatever the remark , it brought a sly grin to her ruby lips . She said , " I 'm Kimberly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve , " Steve replied . " And this is Meg. " // " Hi , Meg , " Kimberly cooed . // I flashed a wan smile and murmured hello . All through the introductions , I felt as if the man was judging me or waiting for me to make a mistake , but what could I possibly do or say that would be wrong ? // " We 're off to Jordan 's beach house , " Kimberly mentioned , providing the information that the man 's name was Jordan and that he had a beach house . " Would you like to join us ? I thought we could soak in the hot tub . Would n't that be fun ? " // Knowing that it was precisely the sort of invitation Steve would accept , I immediately declined . " Oh , we could n't impose . " // " Nonsense , Meg , " Kimberly responded . " The weather is so awful . What else is there to do ? You have to come with us. " // She was bent forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unimpeded view of her breasts . I had to admit that they were terrific , and we could see most of them , so it was an easy call to make . The posture was n't an accident ; she was intentionally tantalizing Steve , when I could n't imagine why . Steve was nice enough , but I mean , really ! // She was with Adonis . Why torment poor Steve with what he could n't have ? // Yet , he was hooked like a fish on a line . // " Yeah , we 'll come , " he agreed , countering my refusal . " It sounds great . " // Jordan and Kimberly stood , and we stood , too , but I was very nervous and not able to understand why . We 'd gone off before , partying with people we scarcely knew , so why was I hesitating ? // They were just so different from us , and the differences mattered in a way I could n't identify . // " I 'm parked out front , " Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We walked over from the hotel , " I resisted . " We should be getting back . " // " No problem . " Jordan seemed to be upping the ante . " You can ride with me , and I 'll bring you down when we 're finished . " // Steve was eager and excited , like a kid with a new toy . " Cool ! Let 's do it . " // Jordan and Kimberly exited into the rainy , blustery gale , and we trailed after them . I slowed my pace , so that Steve would have to debate the situation with me before we climbed in Jordan 's car . // " I do n't want to go with them , " I hissed once they were far enough away not to overhear . // " Why not ? " // " I do n't know . I just do n't ! " // " Do n't be a stick in the mud . It 'll be fun . " // " We do n't know anything about them . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax murderer . Maybe he 's scouting us as his next victims . " // " Right ! " Steve laughed . " Why are you so worried ? Lighten up . " // We were outside and huddled under the awning at the entrance to the restaurant . Jordan was across the parking lot , helping Kimberly into an expensive SUV . Through the shadows , I could see his eyes glimmering , focused directly on me . Although he had n't uttered a word , I perceived how keen he was for me to go with him . I was certain he 'd intervene to guarantee I did n't escape . Why ? Why would my presence or absence be so important to him ? // I grabbed Steve 's arm and pulled him to a halt . // " This is too weird . Why would they ask us over ? " // " Because it 's storming , and boring as hell out here , and they 're dying for some company . " // Even though I 'd never previously met them , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had been searching for us . " But why would they want us ? " // " We 're the only human beings available in a twenty-mile radius . " He gestured around the deserted lot . Jordan 's car was the sole one in it . " Do n't make me hang out at the hotel , Meg . Please . If I have to sit there all night , with no electricity and nothing to do , I 'll go crazy . " // " We could play cards , " I petulantly reminded him . " That would n't be so bad . " // " I played cards with you for three hours today . " I scowled , and he hastily added , " Not that it was n't entertaining , but Meg , they have a hot tub . " // He pronounced hot tub as if it was the Holy Grail , and I knew I was whipped . It was a luxury he relished and hardly ever had a chance to indulge . // " Okay , " I finally grumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I 'm ready , and that we wo n't have a big argument about it . " // Now that he 'd gotten his way , he was all benevolence . " Sure . " // " And I want him to take us over to our car . I do n't want to be without it . " // " Fine . Whatever . " He marched across the lot , and I trotted along behind . // " Hey , Jordan , " he called , " could you swing by the hotel so we can get our car ? Then you wo n't have to drive us back later . " // Jordan nodded and smiled-not at Steve , but at me . It was settled . He 'd won whatever battle we 'd been waging . I was going , and I could n't evade him or the disaster I sensed approaching like an inevitable train wreck . 
@@4022176 The photo shoot in the Place de la Concorde , in Paris , had been going since eight o'clock that morning . They had an area around one of the fountains cordoned off , and a bored-looking Parisian gendarme stood watching the proceedings . The model stood in the fountain for hours on end , jumping , splashing , laughing , her head thrown back in practiced glee , and each time she did it , she was convincing . She was wearing an evening gown hiked up to her knees , and a mink wrap . A powerful battery-operated fan blew her long blond hair out in a mane behind her . // Passersby stopped and stared , fascinated by the scene as a makeup artist in a tank top and shorts climbed in and out of the fountain to keep the model 's makeup perfect . By noon , the model still looked like she was having a fabulous time , as she laughed with the photographer and his two assistants between shots as well as on camera . Cars slowed as they drove by , and two American teenagers stopped and stared in amazement as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , Mom ! It 's Candy ! " the older of the two girls intoned with awe . They were on vacation in Paris from Chicago , but even Parisians recognized Candy easily . She was the most successful supermodel in America , and on the international scene , and had been since she was seventeen . Candy was twenty-one now , and had made a fortune modeling in New York , Paris , London , Milan , Tokyo , and a dozen other cities . The agency could barely handle the volume of her bookings . She was on the cover of Vogue at least twice a year , and was in constant demand . Candy was , without a doubt , the hottest model in the business , and a household name even to those who knew little about fashion . // Her full name was Candy Adams , but she never used her last name , just Candy . She did n't need more than that . Everybody knew her , her face , her name , her reputation as one of the world 's leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether she was running through snow barefoot in a bikini in the freezing cold in Switzerland , walking through the surf in an evening gown in the winter on Long Island , or wearing a full-length sable coat under a blazing sun in the Tuscan hills . Whatever she did , she looked as though she was having a ball doing it . Standing in the fountain in the Place de la Concorde in July was easy , despite the heat and the morning sun , in one of Paris 's standard summer heat waves . The shoot was for another Vogue cover , for the October issue , and the photographer , Matt Harding , was one of the biggest in the business . They had worked together hundreds of times over the last four years , and he loved shooting with her . // Unlike other models as important as she was , Candy was always easy-good-natured , funny , irreverent , sweet , and surprisingly naive after the success she 'd enjoyed since the beginning of her career . She was just a nice person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single bad angle . Her face was virtually perfect for the camera , with no flaws , no defects . She had the delicacy of a cameo , with finely carved features , miles of naturally blond hair that she wore long most of the time , and blue eyes the color of sky and the size of saucers . Matt knew she liked to party hard and stay out late , and amazingly it never showed in her face the next day . She was one of the lucky few who could get away with playing and never have it show afterward . She would n't be able to get away with it forever , but for now she still could . If anything , she only got prettier with age , although at twenty-one , one could hardly expect her to be touched by the ravages of time , but some models started to show it even at her age . Candy did n't . And her natural sweetness still showed through just as it had the first day he 'd met her , when she was seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loved her . Everyone did . There was n't a man or woman in the business who did n't love Candy . // She stood six foot one in bare feet , weighed a hundred and sixteen pounds on a heavy day , and he knew she never ate , but whatever the reason for her light weight , it looked great on her . Although she was thin in person , she always looked fabulous in the images he took of her . Just like Vogue , which adored her and had assigned him to work with her on this shoot , Candy was his favorite model . // They wrapped up the shoot at twelve-thirty , and she climbed out of the fountain as though she had only been in it for ten minutes , instead of four and a half hours . They were doing a second setup at the Arc de Triomphe that afternoon , and one that night at the Eiffel Tower , with the sparklers going off behind them . Candy never complained about difficult conditions or long hours , which was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fact that you could n't get a bad photograph of her . Her face was the most forgiving on the planet , and the most desirable . // " Where do you want to go for lunch ? " Matt asked her , as his assistants put away his cameras and tripod and locked up the film , while Candy slipped out of the white mink wrap and dried her legs with a towel . She was smiling , and looked as though she had enjoyed it thoroughly . // " I do n't know . L'Avenue ? " she suggested with a smile . She was easy . They had plenty of time . It would take his assistants roughly two hours to set up the shoot at the Arc de Triomphe . He had gone over all the details and angles with them the day before , and he did n't need to be there until they had the shot fully ready . That gave him and Candy a couple of hours for lunch . Many models and fashion gurus frequented L'Avenue , also Costes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assortment of Paris haunts . He liked L'Avenue too , and it was close to where they were going to shoot that afternoon . He knew it did n't matter where they went , she was n't likely to eat much anyway , just consume gallons of water , which was what all the models did . They flushed their systems constantly so they did n't gain an ounce . And with the two lettuce leaves Candy usually ate , she was hardly likely to put on weight . If anything , she got thinner every year . But she looked healthy , in spite of her enormous height , and ridiculously light weight . You could see all the bones in her shoulders , chest , and ribs . Just as she was more famous than most of her counterparts , she was also thinner than most . It worried Matt for her sometimes , although she just laughed when he accused her of having an eating disorder . Candy never responded to comments about her weight . Most major models flirted with or suffered from anorexia , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come in these sizes , not after the age of nine . Adult women , who ate even halfway normally , just were n't that thin . // They had a car and driver who took them to the restaurant on the Avenue Montaigne , and as usual at that hour and time of year , it was mobbed . The couture collections were being shown the following week , and designers , photographers , and models had already started to fly in . In addition , it was high tourist season in Paris . Americans loved the restaurant , but so did trendy Parisians . It was always a scene . One of the owners spotted Candy immediately , and showed them to a table on the glassed-in terrace , which they referred to as the " Veranda . " It was where she liked to sit . She loved the fact that she could smoke in any restaurant in Paris . She was n't a heavy smoker , but indulged occasionally , and she liked having the freedom to do it , without getting dark looks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few women who made smoking look appealing . She did everything with grace , and could make tying her shoelaces look sexy . She simply had that kind of style . // Matt ordered a glass of white wine before lunch , and Candy asked for a large bottle of water . She had left the giant water bottle she usually toted around in the car . She ordered a salad for lunch , without dressing , Matt ordered steak tartare , and they settled back to relax , as people at tables around them stared at her . Everyone in the place had recognized her . She was wearing jeans and a tank top and flat silver sandals she had bought the year before in Portofino . She often had sandals made there , or in St. Tropez ; she usually got there every summer . You could see her nipples through the thin white cotton tank top , which did n't bother her at all , nor the men who watched her . She was totally at ease in her own skin , and with who she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tropez this weekend ? " Matt asked , assuming she was . " There 's a party on Valentino 's yacht . " He knew that Candy would have been one of the first to be asked , and she rarely turned down an invitation , and surely not this one . She usually stayed at the Byblos Hotel , with friends , or on someone 's yacht . Candy always had a million options , and was in huge demand , as a celebrity , a woman , and a guest . Everyone wanted to be able to say she 'd be there , so others would come . People used her as a lure , and proof of their social prowess . It was a hard burden to carry , and often crossed the line into exploitation , but she did n't seem to mind , and was used to it . She went where she wanted to , and where she thought she 'd have the best time . But this time she surprised him . Despite her incredible looks , she was a woman of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected . Candy was not only gorgeous but decent , and very bright , even if still naive and young , despite her success . Matt liked that about her . There was nothing jaded about Candy , and she enjoyed it all , whatever she did . // " I ca n't go to St. Tropez , " she said , picking at her lettuce . So far , he had seen her actually swallow two bites . // " Other plans ? " // " Yeah , " she said simply , smiling . " I have to go home . My parents give a Fourth of July party every year , and my mother would kill me if I did n't show up . It 's a command performance for me and my sisters . " Matt knew she was close to them . None of her sisters were models , and if he remembered correctly , she was the youngest . She talked about her family a lot and was very close to them . // " Are n't you doing the couture shows next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bride , and had been Saint Laurent 's before they closed . She made a spectacular bride . // " Not this year . I 'm taking two weeks off . I promised . Usually I go home for the party , and come back just in time for the shows . This year I figured I 'd stay home for a couple of weeks and hang out . I have n't seen all my sisters in one place since Christmas . It 's pretty hard with everyone away from home , mostly me . I 've hardly been in New York since March , and my mom 's been complaining , so I 'm staying home for two weeks and then I have to go to Tokyo after that for a shoot for Japanese Vogue . " It was where a lot of the models made big money , and Candy made more than most . The Japanese fashion magazines ate her up . They loved her blond looks and her height . // " My mom gets really pissed when I do n't come home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so funny ? " // " You . You 're the hottest model in the business , and you 're worried about your mom getting mad if you do n't go home for the Fourth of July barbecue , or picnic , or whatever it is . That 's what I love about you . You 're really still a kid . " She shrugged with an impish smile . // " I love my mom , " she said honestly , " and my sisters . My mom gets really upset when we do n't come home . Fourth of July , Thanksgiving , Christmas . I missed Thanksgiving once , and she gave me shit about it for a year . As far as she 's concerned , family comes first . I think she 's right . When I have kids , I want that too . This stuff is fun , but it does n't last forever . Family does . " // Candy still had all the same values she 'd been brought up with , and believed in them profoundly , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was even more important to her . Much more so than the men in her life , who thus far had been brief and fleeting , and from what Matt had observed were usually jerks , either young ones just trying to show off by being out with her , or older ones who often had a more sinister agenda . Like many other beautiful young women , she was a magnet to men who wanted to use her , usually by being seen with her , and enjoying the perks of her success . The most recent one had been a famous Italian playboy who was notorious for the beautiful women he went out with-for about two minutes . Before that , there had been a young British lord , who looked normal but had suggested whips and bondage , and Candy found out later he was bisexual and deep into drugs . Candy had been startled , and ran like hell , although it was not the first time she 'd had that kind of offer . In the last four years , she 'd heard it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have the time or the desire to settle down , and the kind of men she met were not the kind she wanted to stay with . She always said that she 'd never been in love , although she had been out with a lot of men , but none of them worthwhile , since the boy she 'd been involved with in high school . He was still in college now , and they had lost touch . // Candy had never gone to college . Her first big modeling break had happened in her senior year in high school , and she had promised her parents she 'd go back to school later . She wanted to take advantage of the opportunities she had , while she had them . She put aside a ton of money , although she 'd spent plenty on a penthouse apartment in New York , and a lot of great clothes and fancy pastimes . College was becoming an ever more unlikely plan . She just could n't see the point . Besides , as she always pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her sisters , or so she claimed . Her parents and sisters denied it , and still thought she should go to college when her life slowed down , if it ever did . But for now , she was still going at full speed , and loving every minute of it . She was on the fast track , fully enjoying the fruits of her enormous success . // " I ca n't believe you 're going home for a Fourth of July picnic , or whatever the hell it is . Can I talk you out of it ? " Matt asked hopefully . He had a girlfriend , but she was n't in France , and he and Candy had always been good friends . He enjoyed her company , and it would be much more amusing having her in St. Tropez for the weekend . // " Nope , " she answered , obviously unswayable . " My mom would be heartbroken . I ca n't do that to her . And my sisters would be really pissed . They 're all coming home too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure they do n't have choices like parties on Valentino 's yacht . " // " No , but they have stuff to do too . We all go home for the Fourth of July , no matter what . " // " How patriotic , " he said cynically , teasing her , as people continued to walk past their table and stare . You could see Candy 's breasts through her paper-thin white tank top , which was a man 's undershirt , a " wife beater " as they called it in the business . She wore them a lot , and did n't need a bra . She had had her breasts enlarged three years before , and they contrasted sharply with her rail-thin body . The new ones were n't huge , but they were spectacular looking and had been done well . They were still soft to the touch , unlike most breast implants , particularly those that cost less . She had had hers done at the best plastic surgeon in New York , much to her mother and sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it for her work . None of her sisters or her mother would have considered doing such a thing , and two of them did n't need to . And her mother still had a great figure and was beautiful at fifty-seven . // All the women in the family were knockouts , although their looks were very different from each other . Candy looked nothing like the other women in her family . She was by far the tallest , and she had her father 's looks and height . He was a very good-looking man , had played football at Yale , was six foot four , and he had blond hair like hers when he was young . Jim Adams was turning sixty in December . Neither one of her parents looked their age . They were still a striking couple . Like Candy 's sister Tammy , her mother was a redhead . Her sister Annie 's hair was chestnut brown with coppery auburn highlights , and her sister Sabrina 's hair was almost jet black . They had one of every color , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had looked like the old Breck ads , eastern , patrician , distinguished , and handsome . The four girls had been beautiful as children , and often caused comment , and still did when they went out together , even with their mother . Because of her height , weight , fame , and profession , Candy always got the most attention , but the others were lovely too . // They finished lunch at L'Avenue . Matt ate a pink macaron with raspberry sauce on it , while Candy grimaced and said it was too sweet , and drank a cup of black caf filter , allowing herself one tiny square of chocolate as a treat , which was rare . The driver took them to the Arc de Triomphe after lunch . They had a trailer for her there , parked on the Avenue Foch , behind the Arc de Triomphe , and after a short time she emerged in a startlingly beautiful red evening gown , trailing a sable wrap behind her . She looked absolutely breathtaking , as two policemen helped her cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for her under the huge French flag flying from the Arc de Triomphe . Matt beamed as he saw her coming . Candy was truly the most beautiful woman he 'd ever seen , and possibly in the world . // From the Hardcover edition . // Continues ...

" // " Believe it or not , son , there are aspects of my old life I remember fondly . It was n't all bad .

Paying attention to the busy Los Angeles thoroughfare while having this unexpected conversation with his father would tax anybody 's ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where is this place you found , and how did you find it ? " // " I read about it in the Sentinel about six months ago . " // His father read the local newspaper ? This man was surprising him more and more . Nate wanted nothing to do with the town , yet his dad maintained his ties . Maybe prison life did that to a person . Made you appreciate what you had before , even if it was less than ideal . " Okay , where is it ? " he said . " It 's right on Lake Michigan , " Harley told him . // " In fact , you know it well . " He paused . When Nate did n't say anything , he said , " It 's the Cove Lighthouse , Nate . It 's for sale . " // " The lighthouse ? " Nate 's voice sounded unnaturally high-pitched in his own ears . // " Yep . It 's perfect . " // How could a lighthouse be for sale ? Were n't they public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Finnegan Cove was connected to the lighthouse , some in a good way , some in a bad , and in the case of two families , connected tragically . // But for Nate , the building had been a refuge , one he 'd eventually come to think of as his personal space . Almost as if the abandoned structure had needed him as much as he needed it . // Until that night in 1988. // Harley cleared his throat . " Are n't you going to say something ? " // Nate tried to keep his voice calm . " The lighthouse is absolutely the worst place you could go . I ca n't believe you 're even considering it . " // Harley hesitated . " You have to trust me on this , Nate . " // " But it does n't make sense , Dad . " // " I checked into it . The price is right . Eighty thousand dollars . " // As if price was the only concern . But Nate followed this thread of thought . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building if that 's what they 're asking . Who 's selling it , anyway ? " // " The town council . They 've owned it since the Coast Guard deeded it to them in the sixties . " // All at once time stood still for Nate . He pictured the six-story beacon tower protruding from the roof of the small cottage flanked by oak trees . He and his father had guided their commercial fishing boat into the channel by its light many times . The closer they got to the lighthouse , the closer they were to home . Those , at least , were good memories , because that was when they 'd had a home . // The wheels began to turn in Nate 's head as he struggled to come up with a positive aspect to his father 's decision . Harley was right about one thing . The Finnegan Cove Lighthouse was remote , sheltered , private . As long as he was set on going back there , maybe this was the perfect spot for him . // Nate sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you know what condition the place is in ? " he asked . He wondered when the light station had been built , and seemed to recall a date from the late eighteen hundreds . " It could be falling down . " // " I suppose , " Harley conceded . " But I saw a picture of it . Does n't look too bad . And I could fix it up . I 'd enjoy doing that . " // " We should have somebody look at it , someone who knows about architectural structure , " Nate said , hoping this logical step would put an end to his father 's irrational plan . " Fine . " He paused . " Maybe I should try to call- " Sensing what his father was about to say , and knowing how his brother would react to a call from Harley , Nate stopped him . " Let me handle it , " he said . He had been gone for two decades , only traveling to Michigan once or twice a year to visit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never been back to Finnegan Cove . But he did know that Mike , a contractor who lived in Sutter 's Point about twenty miles away , was a stranger to both of them now . That was how Mike wanted it . // " Let me make the phone call , " he said , and then realized , because of his current schedule , there was nothing to keep him in Los Angeles . " Maybe I 'll fly out and take a look at the place myself . " // " That 'd be great , son , " his father said , clearly pleased . " I might be seeing you soon , eh ? " // " Maybe . I 'll talk to you . " // He disconnected , shook his head and got out of his car . This was a crazy idea . If that lighthouse had n't washed into Lake Michigan , it had to be pretty damn close . But all at once the thought of buying that old place , fixing it up.well , maybe his father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of them working with their hands , as they had in the old days , when they used to pull in nets loaded with the catch of the day , might be exactly what he and Harley needed . // Of course , the first step in evaluating the practicality of this plan was n't going to be easy . Nate had n't spoken to his brother in years . // He took the elevator to the fourteenth floor , went inside his condo and got his address book from the desk . He poured himself a gin and tonic and sat at the bar . Then he punched in the phone number of Mike Shelton . Maybe his brother would n't be too busy on a Friday evening to talk to him . If he 'd talk to him at all . // A kid answered the phone . Nate 's nephew . He 'd be ten now . " Is Mike there ? " Nate asked . // " Yes . Who 's calling ?

@@4022184 Rock Gods // Altars . Saviors . Rock ' n ' roll . I braved my fear of spiders , dust plumes as thick as L.A. smog , and the stench of dog piss that the last owner of the house had let permeate the basement to tirelessly search my father 's record collection for my next holy grail . Sitting on that cold , dirty , painted cement floor in my blue jeans , with the Wisconsin winter creeping through the tired walls and windows of our house , I dug through crates of albums , feeling their perfect square edges poke between my fingers . The slap of plastic dust cover against plastic dust cover was so satisfying , but the best moment came when I found the record I wanted , slipped it out of its paper jacket and onto the record player . The needle skipped and skittered for a few seconds until it found its groove , the first chord scratching its way through the speakers , a catchy chorus reverberating in my ears . Earthquakes . Rock gods . // Music was in my blood . My mother left me with my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginnings of punk rock around the country . Detroit . New York . L.A. We never heard from her again . Neither of us was resentful . She had her reasons . At least that 's what I told myself . // Two months after she disappeared , my dad moved us from our tiny apartment in Chicago to Carlisle , Wisconsin , the small farming town fifteen miles beyond the Illinois border where he and my mother had grown up . When we first returned to the land of lush fields , acres of corn , and barns that sat fat and yawning at the ends of dirt roads , people talked . It was just that kind of place , a small , tight-knit community ; any deviation from the norm was grounds for discussion . // Before areas were incorporated , when land was simply land , Carlisle was born of a general store that farmers flocked to from miles away . Back then , the men talked about their work while picking up seed and parts for aging equipment . Their wives came for cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged advice about family matters and gossiped about the other women who had asked them for advice . // As the years passed , the government bought up land to build roads , and corporations turned family farms into giant factory farms . People moved closer together , and from the general store sprung a main street scattered with businesses . Two miles away a food-processing plant opened . The sprawling community shrunk into a town made up of the farms that remained nearby and the former farming families who took jobs at the plant or opened storefronts . Side streets attached themselves to Main Street in a neat grid near the center of town , but farther out , roads meandered around fields . From above , the layout of Carlisle looked like straight hair -- parted in the middle by Main Street -- suddenly gone curly at the ends . // But everyone still knew one another . Everyone still gathered in front of the store or at the tavern to talk . No modernization would ever change that . // I do n't want you thinking I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up with all the modern comforts : indoor plumbing , cable TV . What set Carlisle apart from urban areas was the way everyone clung to history . Not like **29;606;TOOLONG history , more like **54;637;TOOLONG history . From snippets of conversation , I knew who I was , who my family was , and how we fit into town lore . The most popular topic from the time I came to Carlisle until the day I left was the high school football team . The second most common topic was the people who did n't seem to care about normal things like football , the people who just were n't quite right . // Like Paula Collins , whose parents had both perished in a barn fire when she was sixteen . She inherited all the money they 'd squirreled away and the land they lived on , and she never left , never married , never rebuilt that barn . Or Norma Lisbon , who was well on her way to being the town drunk even before her son , Eric , killed himself . After Eric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute , and Norma was drunk , disorderly , and doing something gossip-worthy nearly every day . // Or like my family ... // My parents , Michael Black and Louisa Carson , had created quite a scene in 1974 , when they sped out of town on my father 's motorcycle . As a teenager , I walked into many discussions about it at the local gas station and grocery store , but my favorite version , the only one I took as gospel , was the one my mother 's best friend , Molly Parker , told me. // It was an unusually warm day in April when Michael and Louisa fled , Louisa 's eighteenth birthday , and she made sure all of Carlisle knew that she was an adult and finally free to leave the tiny town that had smothered her with old-fashioned morals . My father concentrated on the drive , thinking the only way to save the girl he loved from all the anger that ate away at her heart was to help her escape . His black leather jacket and wild , coffee-colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the road , which was appropriate because before Michael Black was seen in the company of Louisa Carson , no one in Carlisle had ever noticed him . As she had since she arrived in the town at the age of ten , the pretty but untamed doctor 's daughter , Louisa , was the one causing the ruckus . Burning down Main Street on the back of his Harley , she held on to Michael with one arm , her bleached-blond hair tangling like corn silk in the wind as she turned dangerously in her seat to shout obscenities and shake her fist at Carlisle . Outside of Carlisle Groceries and Meats , a crowd of middle-aged women doing their weekly shopping and work-worn men picking up packs of smokes on their way to the job gathered to gawk at the spectacle . Louisa tugged off her black high heels and whipped one through the window of the grocery store , the other against the Old Style sign that flickered above the doorway of JT 's Tavern . With that final act of aggression , she wrapped both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // So , when my father returned almost three years later in a blue Chevy Impala with me , Emily Diana Black , asleep in the backseat , everyone had questions . They contemplated why he 'd returned alone , wearing a wedding ring and carrying a milk-skinned baby with a shock of hair as dark as her last name , and blazing , green eyes that left no doubt she was Louisa 's . They theorized about why Louisa had left him and wondered if I would end up as wild as she had been . // Molly overheard one of the many conversations in Carlisle Groceries and Meats soon after our return . As Molly put little jars of baby food into her basket , Mrs. Jones , wife of the store owner , openly discussed the situation with her customer , Sarah Fawcett . " Well , Michael had some of those hippie tendencies . That 's probably how he ended up with that woman , " she stated frankly , pushing the paper bag with Sarah 's things across the counter to her . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Long hair , and that bike , of course . " // " Yes . " Old Mrs. Jones tightly clamped her thin , pasty lips together to give a dramatic moment of pause before she shared her vast knowledge . As one of the most well-known people in Carlisle , she considered herself the authority on every topic . " Michael was from a good family . Not a rich family like hers , " she added snidely , " but the Blacks have lived around here forever . I do n't know what he saw in that girl , but I 'm sure she was a terrible wife , which 'll drive even the gentlest man to his wit 's end eventually . " // Sarah nodded enthusiastically : at the time she was a young wife , seven months pregnant , and wished to prove she had the moral fiber that others from her generation , such as Louisa , lacked . // Molly emerged from the aisle and headed angrily toward the counter . Mrs. Jones continued , " I 'm sure three years drained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket down , Mrs. Jones paused and stared at her from wrinkly eye sockets , then finished her sentence . " Now he 's back to raise his daughter right . " // That was the consensus of the town . When my dad took work at the plant , people seemed to remember that he was the quiet son of a respected farmer , so they disregarded any of his remaining eccentricities , such as never removing his wedding ring , and the talk simmered down to a whisper until I reached my high school years . // My dad and I lived in a house that was big but cheap , weathered but solid , old but transformed by the rock ' n ' roll energy that he and I breathed . My dad raised me on music . Our living room was a temple , plastered with posters of Bowie and the Rolling Stones . A framed , signed Beatles record hung over the stereo , which was our altar in the center of the room . A photograph of my mother sat on the left speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My dad 's taste ran the gamut , from classical to blues to punk to folk . Even into his forties , he amazed me by discovering the best underground bands before I did . Three records never left that stack on the speaker : one each by Johnny Cash , Leadbelly , and the Clash . The basement held crates and crates of other records , and as I grew older , that became the place I ran to immediately after dinner . // I knelt on that cold cement floor , dust clouds poofing up around me as I flipped faster and faster through the albums . " There has to be something good in here . Do n't tell me it 's all folk crap , " I complained , craving noisy guitars the way other nine-year-olds hungered for candy . // " That 's rock , too , Emily , " my father chided from behind me , looking slightly disappointed that I was n't finding nearly as much satisfaction in his old record collection as he did . His dark eyes drank in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line that wanted to be hummed , or words in the record 's defense that would have been wasted on me. // " No , it 's not noisy enough , " I replied . I wanted something that you could feel in your throat when you played it loud , something that churned through your stomach and shook you to the tips of your toes . Something that scraped out your insides and made you want to dance without them . Just as I searched for the steepest hill to ride my bike down , I hunted for music that would provide the greatest thrill . // My dad 's wavy hair fell across his brow as he laughed softly . Everything about my father was soft except for his hardworking hands . Just twenty-one when I was born , he still looked young , more like an older brother than a dad . However , since he stood over six feet tall , so much bigger than I was , I always viewed him as my protector . As tough as I acted , on many occasions I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be soothed by the sound of his voice or the thump of his big heart . Most important , he was also my playmate . He went along with my nightly exploration of the records , sharing in both the delight and the seriousness of my mission . // " It 's got ta be noisy , huh ? " He smiled impishly . His brown eyes sparkled like they were lit by stage lights . " Your mother would be proud of you , " he said . The glimmer in his eyes changed just slightly ; a sense of longing always emerged when she came up in conversation . // " Are any of Louisa 's records around here ? " I asked . I rarely referred to my mother by anything other than her first name . She was even more distant than the rock gods in Rolling Stone . I had nothing of hers but photographs . I possessed the energy and voices of my icons through their music , but I remembered neither about Louisa . // " Somewhere . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teased , scooting away from the crate to stretch out on the floor . // " Louisa left some records with you ! " I exclaimed , my hair slicing through the air between us as I twisted around to look at him . I 'd been asking that question since I was five years old , but he never answered . I knew I had to have those records . They would be my mother . They would let me know her voice , her thoughts , the stories she would have told me before bed . They would help me re-create the moment I knew I would never remember : the night she decided she could no longer ignore punk rock 's summons and kissed me good-bye . " I 'm old enough ! I ca n't believe you 've just let ' em rot down here , Dad ! Damn ! " // " Emily , do n't swear , " he scolded affectionately , leaning back with his hands behind him . // " I 'm sorry . I just want them so bad .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create my own altar , how I would stack Louisa 's records right next to the little stereo that sat across from my bed . " I just know they 're so cool ! " I exhaled , curling my dusty fingers in my long , tangled hair and then leaping onto my father . He sat up quickly to catch me. // " You are certainly Louisa 's daughter . " Dad grinned . " Nine years old and you want to make the windows rattle and the floorboards creak with blasting speakers . " He slid me off his lap , stood up , and led me past his tool bench , the furnace , and boxes full of Christmas decorations to a little closet that I 'd never looked in , certain it only contained bugs and mice . It was surprisingly clean , and up on the top shelf perched a red milk crate with about twenty records in it . My holy grail . // Play it harder . Play it faster . Louder . Harder . Faster . So loudhardfast that I forget your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first place ? Those were the first lyrics I composed myself . I wrote them the summer I turned fourteen . As a little girl I felt the music in my gut and in the tips of my fingers , making me want to sing at the top of my lungs and learn to play guitar as well as my father . When puberty hit , I started to feel music between my thighs . My legs stretched long and slim , and my hip bones jutted out . I dressed in vintage blue jeans so worn they clung to me without being tight in that trashy way the girls with big , ratted bangs at my high school preferred . My hair , still as dark as my name , hung straight and thick , dusting the middle of my back when I pushed it behind me . The only makeup I wore then was black eyeliner and red lipstick . // Every weekend I walked around town with Molly 's daughter , Regan . Since I was a baby , I 'd spent my days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like the sister of her two girls , Regan , who was only four months older than me , and Marissa , who was four years older . My dad told me that Louisa would have loved it that I was best friends with her best friend 's kid . Regan even looked like Molly , a tiny but feisty girl who stood a few inches shorter than me , the red highlights in her chocolate hair glistening in the sun as we prowled the streets of Carlisle . // Main Street had changed since Louisa made her dramatic exit sixteen years earlier . Two blocks beyond Car &shy; lisle Groceries and Meats a strip mall had sprung up where Main Street became County Highway PW , the speed limit jumping from twenty-five miles per hour to forty-five right in front of the entrance to the brand-new Wal-Mart . Regan and I spent our Saturday afternoons in that vast , brightly lit emporium of crap , shoplifting everything from sodas to candles to black bras. // On those treks down Main Street the summer before freshman year , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of how much I 'd grown to look like her on the outside , but I knew that I was most like Louisa on the inside . I understood why she 'd hated Carlisle . Like all small Midwestern towns , it evolved slowly . It lagged at least a decade behind when it came to any cultural advancement . As the rest of the country moved into the nineties , Carlisle hung on to 1979 . The women still had badly feathered hair . The men who whistled at Regan and me from their battered pickup trucks still had Styx and REO Speedwagon blaring through the speakers . Louisa , who 'd entered her teenage years in 1969 , lived in a town still stuck in the fifties . Like her , I saw two ways to escape Carlisle : sex and rock ' n ' roll . For the first time , I thought I heard my mother 's voice inside of me . Play it harder . Play it faster . Louder . Harder . Faster . So loudhardfast that I forget your name . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam thought he was destined to be the biggest rock god the world had ever known . I thought so , too , but hell , I was only fourteen . Back then , we spent our days at Wal-Mart and our nights at River 's Edge , an abandoned warehouse three miles from the outskirts of town and just as far from the nearest farmhouse . Kids came from all over two or three counties to listen to the raucous , angry music that bands pounded out at the Edge , the closest thing rural southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois had to underground rock , and the only place where Regan and I could find cute punk boys . // The afternoon before I met Sam , as Regan and I slid black lace panties on in the fitting room at Wal-Mart , she shouted over the partition , " Tonight 's the night , Emily . We 're going to find you some sexy punk to fuck out at River 's Edge . " We 'd made a pact at the beginning of the summer that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked up with a guy at River 's Edge the previous weekend , it was my turn to seal the deal . // I zipped up my jeans and shouted back to her , " I do n't care what he looks like as long as he 's in a band . " I was , of course , being somewhat sarcastic . He had to be in a good band . // " That 's my girl . " Regan laughed as we stepped out of our stalls at the same time . The clerk standing outside the fitting room , a plump woman with an overprocessed perm , gaped at us , horrified . // " You 're Molly Dahle 's daughter , " she hissed at Regan , flecks of spit curdling her coral lipstick . " You better watch it or you 're gon na end up just like your mama , " she continued , wearing the look of a satisfied hog , " knocked up at sixteen . " // Regan glared at the woman , her hazel eyes turning the color of embers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try on and corrected , " Parker . It 's been Molly Parker for eighteen years now . Let me guess , you were prom queen ? Class of ' 74 ? And you laughed your ass off when my mother dropped out to have my sister . But here you are now , fat and old , and my mother is still as thin and pretty as she was back then . Not to mention she 's happily married , whereas you ... I bet you have n't gotten laid since prom night , you dried-up -- " // " Shut up ! " the woman bellowed , cheeks flaring and watery blue eyes bulging . Wal-Mart shoppers from intimate apparel to housewares gawked. // Regan gazed innocently at her audience . When she was n't glaring or cursing , Regan 's size made people think she was n't a day over twelve . She backed away from the clerk , acting shocked . " I 'm sorry , ma'am , " she said sweetly , but loud enough for the silent store to hear . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I sashayed through the racks of clothingtoward the aisle . I glanced back and saw the store manager storming toward the clerk . I had no doubt she would try to tell him whose children we were , but the beauty of the new Wal-Mart was that it was run by folks from outside of Carlisle and even attracted many of its customers from surrounding towns . At Carlisle Groceries and Meats , Regan and I had been watched since the age of five for signs that we were like our awful mamas . At twelve , when we got caught smoking cigarettes behind the store , it was attributed to the evil we 'd sucked down in our mothers ' milk . But the managers of Wal-Mart viewed us as their corporate offices instructed . We were customers and the employees were not to let petty , small-town gossip interfere with proper customer service . As the manager lectured the clerk about this , Regan and I exited without suspicion , new underwear beneath our jeans and purses stuffed with stolen makeup and lighters. // Still snickering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big wraparound porches , painted bright shades of white , yellow , blue , and red . Downtown Carlisle was the nicer part of town . Farther south , the sun-faded and boxy houses looked as if a major snowstorm would reduce them to a pile of waterlogged boards . Our families lived in the area in between . At the intersection of Main and Laurel , we parted ways . " Marissa and I will meet you at the Edge at eight tonight , " Regan reminded me. // Of course , they were late . // My dad dropped me off on his way to play music with the guys from his high school band . It was n't a serious project , but Dad joked that it kept him in touch with his roots and helped him escape my noise . // I waited for Regan and Marissa on the outskirts of what was used as a parking lot at River 's Edge . Cars lined up next to the warehouse , their tires treading worn gravel , broken glass , and thick ruts of dirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tufts , nourished by spilt beer and cigarette butts . Just a few feet away from me , it was lush , green , and tall , which made the area surrounding the warehouse look like the patchy head of a balding man . // No one knew where the name River 's Edge came from . There was no sign that a river had run anywhere nearby in the last century , the nearest being the Pecatonica , five miles away . Maybe it was the name of the company that once owned the building . Even my dad , who met my mother there eighteen years earlier , had no idea . But I enjoyed the rural tradition of legend , and River 's Edge was steeped in it . // In the late seventies , when someone -- maybe the cops , maybe the electric company -- noticed that the warehouse was being used , they shut it down for a couple months . Then someone -- or maybe a few people -- bought the property . No one knew who 'd done it because nothing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a legitimate club would have meant security , controlling underage drinking , and taking a cut from the money the bands made . The mysterious owner just left an old paint can with a sign that said " Donations " on the wooden table by the door where bands put their flyers and sold their silk-screened T-shirts and low-quality demo tapes . We all kicked in cash whenever we could so the electric bill could be paid and the roof kept leak-free. // River 's Edge ran like a co-op . Volunteers did sound and lighting . Bands scheduled themselves on a calendar backstage . There were three slots a night and rookie acts who did n't know anyone else to sign up with chose a random date and opened by default . Bands from farther away called their friends to be added to the calendar . It created an intricate underground rock network so appreciated by everyone that fighting was rare , despite the edgy , volatile nature of the music . // During my dad 's time , the sound at River 's Edge transitioned from folk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic metal of the eighties . Punk rock still thrived when I started seeing shows there , music that shared some similarities with what was brewing in the Pacific Northwest at the time , but we played it faster , like our lives depended on it . I have no idea why my father allowed me to hang out there . He probably assumed I went to appreciate music the way he 'd raised me to , not realizing that rock possessed me the way it had my mother . If he 'd had any idea that I was getting drunk and checking out boys , he would have tightened the reins . But my dad was very trusting and I was very good at concealing things from him . // I took a swig of cheap , watery beer and squinted through the fiery red light of the setting sun , searching for Marissa 's black Pontiac . Pollen tickled my nose and late-August humidity thickened the hazy air . I finished most of my drink before Marissa and Regan showed up . Regan stumbled out of the passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Marissa stepped out gracefully , a lit cigarette dangling from her bloodred lips . Regan and Marissa both wore the same shade of lipstick , but other than that they looked nothing alike . Marissa resembled their father , tall with sandy hair and aquamarine eyes , while everything about Regan was dark ; she inherited the Native American features of Molly 's father . Marissa stood fluid and curvy , possessing the elegant confidence that Regan and I hoped we 'd find in our own bodies in the next four years . At the same time , Marissa was still bad-ass enough to be our idol . The black halter dress she wore revealed the phoenix tattooed on her left shoulder and her creamy arms , toned from years of playing bassguitar. // We were a mismatched trio . Although I acted like the third sister , I obviously was n't . Paler than both of them , my skin exuded the spooky glow of a full moon . They were both lean and muscular , and I was bony . Truly , we were not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair , and Marissa the kind older sister who provided rides , tried to impart wisdom , and sighed when we ran recklessly ahead , ignoring her . // " Good evening , Emily . " Marissa reached through the window into the backseat of the car for a beer . " Help yourself to the good alcohol , " she added , noticing the Old Milwaukee I held . // I set down my can and stood up as Regan loudly slurred , " Tonight we 're getting Emily laid ! " She chucked a box of condoms at me , which were most likely the rightful property of Wal-Mart. // I rolled my eyes and threw the box back at her . // " That 's all she 's been talking about since we got in the car . Having some regrets about sleeping with that drummer last weekend , Regan ? Need someone to share in your misery ? " Marissa teased , her cheeks rising with her smile . // Regan stuck her tongue out at her sister and bent down to retrieve the condoms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with . The first time 's no good anyway . It 's like opening a wound . " // Marissa chuckled , rounding the car to meet us . " How would you know , Regan ? You 've never had a second time . Maybe it 's always like that . " // Regan raised her bottle of wine , uncoiled one of the fingers wrapped around the neck , and jabbed it in her sister 's face . " How do you know , Marissa ? " she mimicked . " Maybe I screwed that drummer twice . " // Marissa shook her head wisely , her long hair shimmering . " If you had any more sexual experience , you would know that no teenage drummer could do it twice in an hour . Besides , " she added with a giggle , " I know you overheard me saying that ' opening a wound ' thing a couple years ago . " // Regan blushed indignantly . " Shut up ! " // " Oh , Regan , " Marissa sighed , " you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little groupies . " She patted us on the tops of our heads in a motherly fashion and started toward the large , gray building . I watched her black high heels clicking steadily through the dirt and imagined that they were just like the pair Louisa had furiously thrown as she exited Carlisle . I wanted more than anything to combine the cool dignity of Marissa with the uninhibited rage of my mother . And I was convinced that Regan was right , that I would just have to get rid of my virginity to do it . // The opening chords of a fast punk song reverberated inside the warehouse . Feedback sizzled like lightning flashing across the darkening sky , beckoning us . I grabbed a fresh beer from the car and linked my arm with Regan 's as we strode toward the entrance . She took a big gulp of wine and pondered her sister 's words . " We 're not groupies , are we , Em ? " she asked , sounding somber . // " Nah , we 're just bored . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll let me pick out a guy for you tonight ? " // " What the hell , " I agreed , swallowing half the beer to catch up with her drunkenness . " You 'll probably pick a better one than I would . " // " Great ! " Regan squealed . She ripped into the condom box and handed me a strip of them . " You 'll need these , then . Better safe than sorry ! " I pocketed them as she pulled me through the wide doors of the warehouse . " When I find him , I 'll give you a sign . " // Signs were the only way we could communicate inside . No one really monitored the noise level at River 's Edge since there were no neighbors to complain . The warehouse had great natural acoustics . Across one end stretched a stage , built back before my father 's time . It was ridiculously large , allowing bands that should n't have been performing outside of their own basements to feel like they were playing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , so equipment could be unloaded easily . The small backstage area had a dingy , olive-green couch and a few raggedy chairs . Throughout the warehouse , ladders on the wall led to a catwalk that snaked all the way around the inside , eighteen feet above the floor . Sometimes kids climbed up there and watched the band , legs dangling through the metal rails . They dared each other to dive into the thrashing crowd below , but no one ever did . // Audiences ranged from twenty to two hundred kids . Regan and I always scanned for faces we recognized from school . A crew of three older boys , all of whom wore the same leather jackets and spent lunch smoking in the parking lot , showed up semiregularly , but it looked like everyone else was at the game -- football , basketball , baseball , whatever season it was . The kids at River 's Edge arrived in groups of three to five . Like us , they attended rural high schools filled with guys who donned Packers jerseys every Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miniskirts or too-tight , acid-washed jeans . At school , multicolored hair , shredded and patched clothing , and studded , spiked accessories stood out like a neon billboard in the middle of a cornfield would , but at River 's Edge those things blended right in. // By my senior year , when some of the local bands had begun to make names for themselves , more people started showing up -- some of them from as far away as Milwaukee and Chicago -- to see the legendary place where those country kids had gotten their start . They were probably disappointed to find it was much like any other club on the inside -- dirty and dark , the concrete floor covered with that slimy mixture of ashes and beer -- and we were the same group of kids found at any rock show . After all , it was the nineties . Just because we lived in the sticks did n't mean we were completely cut off from subculture . We just took more shit from our neighbors and classmates for looking strange . // The crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors , but the area up to fifteen feet away from the stage was packed with sweaty , bouncing bodies . Regan barreled in , shoving burly guys twice her size out of her path . She liked to be right up front , getting slammed into the stage with the rhythm of the song . For some sick reason , I enjoyed being trampled and bruised , too . It was another phase that Marissa said we 'd get over soon enough . Unless she really loved the band , Marissa stood at the back , splashing her drink on anyone who stepped on her toes . Since she played in July Lies , one of the best bands in the area , Marissa was queen of the scene . Regan and I could have shared her glory , but we liked to get hot , sticky , beat up , and dirty with the masses . // That night , however , Regan dove into the crowd on a mission ; I knew she noticed him when I had . Sam 's band was playing when we walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had a dumb name , Dead Smurfs or Mikey 's Mom or something like that , but Sam was definitely practicing to be a rock god . His guitar hung low so that everyone could see his bare , tattooed chest . He had unwashed , blond hair that picked up the color of the lights . He thrashed a chord so hard that a string snapped , lacerating his finger , and he let it bleed . His voice was guttural and sexy . The music was fast and loud , just the way I liked it . // I pushed through the pit , grabbing at Regan , who always danced with her elbows swinging to knock away all the bigger bodies threatening to crush her . She threw her arm around me in a sweaty embrace and then shoved me in front of her so that I was standing directly in front of Sam . Entranced by him , I could n't even tell if he was genuinely a good musician or if he just knew how to manipulate acoustics and energy . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed . After two songs , she pelted him with condoms , which she must have drunkenly decided would be a good sign . // I whipped around , mouthing " Bitch ! " at her . She laughed hysterically and pointed over my shoulder . I turned back to see Sam smiling down at me , his baby-blue eyes thirsting for fame . // It would n't be the last time I was deceived by a rock god , but it was the only time that my disappointment was unforeseen . Of course , I had n't expected or even wanted romance , but I had craved at least the pleasure of pain . I thought Sam would touch me with the raw power he used to play guitar . I thought he would kiss me and leave bruises on my skin as black-and-blue and dangerous as his voice . And I thought he would be able to satisfy the burn between my legs that surged every time I heard a distorted guitar . I slept with him because we worshipped at the same altars , because he oozed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could absorb it , make it mine . He thought I loved him for his inevitable future rock-god glory , but I had no interest in watching from backstage or vibing to the records he made , gleaming with gratitude that I was his muse . I thought that if we fused together , the world would screech like an amp so charged it caught fire . But it was n't anywhere near that good . // I waited for him behind the stage and he made a beeline for me . After he introduced himself , Sam kissed me hard , shoving me against a steel beam . He tasted like stale beer . He bit my lower lip before thrusting his tongue into my mouth and exploring it violently . I dug my fingernails into his bare back and raked them down , feeling his skin splinter like weak wood . The scratch would become my trademark , the signature I left on every guy I hooked up with . He moaned into our kiss and I felt his pleasure vibrating down my throat and into my stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to whisper , " Let 's go outside . " // Behind Marissa 's car , we tumbled to the ground , pulling our T-shirts over our heads and tugging off each other 's jeans . Night had fallen while Sam 's band played , but the moon lit the sky . Our nakedness was protected from the eyes of others by darkness , though we could still see each other clearly . Sam rolled on top of me , hands groping greedily , stripping off my underwear and then his own as he sloppily sucked on my neck . // " Whoa ! " I firmly planted my palm against the Celtic cross tattooed on his chest . " Condom ? " // " Uhhh ... " // " Right pocket of my jeans , " I demanded . // " Oh . Good , " he mumbled , scrambling backward and rooting through the pile of balled-up clothing at our feet . // Yeah , thank god for Regan . No matter how hot and heavy the action , I was n't about to risk babies or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbed back on top of me . Then he was inside me . I closed my eyes waiting , at first , for the powerful , hungry feeling I 'd felt in his initial kiss . After a few minutes , I opened one eye , still expecting , at the very least , the bleeding ache that Regan had mentioned . Nothing . It did n't feel like dancing while getting bruised by shoulders and elbows and knees . It did n't even feel like drunkenly screaming along to my favorite song . There was nothing raw or even energetic about it . The only thing remotely musical that I could compare it to was tapping my foot . The band inside butchered an Iggy Pop song . As the tone-deaf singer wailed , " Can you feeeeel it ? " I wondered the same thing . And the answer was , " Not really . " // I opened both eyes to see Sam thrusting into me in a way that was so not rhythmic that I doubted whether he 'd ever heard music , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intense concentration . I thought briefly that maybe I was in so much pain I was numb , but then I felt bits of gravel and broken glass digging into my butt . His sweaty hair fell into his face ; the moonlight that trickled through it made it look translucent , as fragile as a spider 's web . That 's when I saw past the grimace on his face , the tattoos that he 'd probably conned someone into giving him , and realized how much he resembled a little boy . He was probably two years older than me , but his inevitable lack of experience still did n't justify my disappointment . // I groped behind me for the beer that I 'd left nearby , praying for a swallow of lukewarm backwash to alleviate my annoyance . Sam 's breathing got faster and more labored , like he was working really hard . He pressed his cheek against mine , his chest rubbing against my black bra , which he had n't even bothered to try to remove . I felt his leg muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the impression of a dying fish . // When he finally rolled off of me , I quickly pulled on my jeans . Sam sighed . " I 'm going to write a song about you , " he murmured . // I stifled my laughter with the beer can I 'd found . Before he could make any more embarrassing statements , I got dressed and walked away . My idea of rock gods had been ruined . They were nothing more than little boys wearing stolen scowls . I knew that the next time I saw Sam play , I would realize his songs sucked . He would be nothing without his rock-god hair flying , his arms flailing , his chest dripping sweat , and his intense eyes zeroing in on every girl in the audience who believed him to be raw power . I would notice that he could n't even play four chords . And most important , I 'd know that the sex would n't even last through three songs . // " Maybe he was just really bad , " Regan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the backseat , reveling in my disillusionment . The wind blew in from both her and Marissa 's open windows , and I hoped that the smell of dirty barns was cleansing me of the scent of Sam 's sweat . // " Well , regardless of that , I learned one thing . No guy fucks like they sound when they 're onstage or blaring at top volume on your stereo . And I 'm sure this knowledge will change my life , " I quipped cynically . // Regan winced . " I swear I 'll pick a better one next time . " // " So will I , " I said with a laugh . // " You girls need to do what I did , " Marissa chimed in . She turned down the original version of " Gim me Danger " that I insisted she put on so my memory of the song would n't be tainted , and met my eyes in the rearview mirror . " Start your own damn band ! " // Regan and I fell silent , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisa had blazed out of , I knew we both were thinking that Marissa was right . // 
@@4022185 The dragon finally opened her eyes.Turning , she found her servant standing by her bed , waiting . She yawned and stretched lazily . " How long have I slept , Tavey ? " she asked her servant , yawning again . // " A little over a hundred years , mistress , " Tavey replied . " The king has called for you . He is in need of your counsel . The purple sand in his hourglass is almost gone . " // " Humph , " the dragon replied . " How typical of Fflergant , " she said . " For all his bleating about tradition he has never done anything in a timely and correct manner . Now as his days end he calls for me . I have advised all the kings of Belmair since time began , but never have I dealt with one such as this king . " // " Perhaps , " Tavey ventured , " it was meant to be this way , mistress . Have you not always said that everything happens for a specific reason ? " // The dragon arose from her bed . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in all her glory she would have stood higher than her own castle . For simplicity 's sake she used her own magic to stand no taller than eight feet . It allowed her to enter the king of Belmair 's residence easily as the chambers there were only twelve feet high . " You know me too well , " she said . " How long have you served me , Tavey ? " // " Since the beginning of time , mistress , " he answered her with just the faintest smile touching his thin lips . // " Humph , " Nidhug responded . She stretched out her hands . // " You have kept my claws nicely trimmed , " she noted . " And my scales are quite supple . " // " I have oiled them weekly , mistress , " Tavey said . " Sleeping should not negate your need for maintenance.You are the Great Dragon of Belmair , mistress . " // " How long ago did Fflergant call for me ? " Nidhug asked her servant . // " Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dragon stretched again , opening her delicate gold wings and extending them briefly before refolding them . She was a very beautiful creature , her scales an iridescent sea-blue and spring-green . The crest upon her head was purple and gold . She had beautiful dark eyes swirled with both gold and silver , and thick , heavy eyelashes that clearly indicated her gender . " Tell Fflergant that I will come to see him in the third hour after the dawn tomorrow morning , " she told Tavey . " But before you go to him , tell the cook I will have two dozen sheep , a dozen sides of beef , a wheel of sharp yellow cheese and six cakes soaked in sweet wine for my dinner . Oh ! And a nice salad , too , Tavey , " Nidhug said . " I am in the mood for greens tonight . " // " At once , mistress , " the servant said , and hurried from the chamber to first speak with the dragon 's cook . " She 's awake , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order for his mistress 's dinner . // " Is she ill ? " the cook wanted to know . " ' T is scarcely a mouthful . " // " It was only a nap , " Tavey said . " Add a few dozen roast geese and capons to the order if it pleases you . She could very well discover she is hungrier than she thought , and will thank you for thinking of it , " he said . Then he slipped out the kitchen door to cross the dragon 's gardens , which led into the king 's gardens and into the king 's castle . Before he could find the king , however , he met the king 's daughter , the sorceress Cinnia. // " Is she awake ? " Cinnia asked immediately upon seeing Tavey. // " Yes , my lady , she is. " // " When will she see my father ? The sands seem to be moving faster , " Cinnia said . // " Come with me , and you will learn the answer to your question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cinnia demanded . // Tavey turned and looked at her . " You are not the king of Belmair , my lady , and my message is for the king , not his daughter . " // Cinnia 's green eyes narrowed , but the dragon 's servant stood his ground . " I should be Belmair 's next ruler , " she said darkly . // " Belmair has never been ruled by a woman , " Tavey replied quietly , and he began to walk toward the king 's chamber once again . // " Does that mean it should n't ? " Cinnia said . // " It is not our tradition , my lady , " her companion replied . " The dragon has always chosen Belmair 's kings . When there has been no son as has happened in this case the dragon chooses a suitable man , and if there is a king 's daughter and she is unmarried , then she weds the new king so that the blood of the old king continues on as will happen for you , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has kept peace on Belmair. " // Cinnia said nothing more . What was there to say ? Her fate had suddenly be taken out of her hands . She was Belmair 's most respected sorceress , but she no longer had any control over her own life . If she attempted to defy tradition she would be punished . The dragon 's magic was far greater than was Cinnia 's , and she was more than well aware of it for it had been the dragon who had taught her . // Reaching the king 's privy chamber , they entered . Fflergant looked pale , but seeing Tavey , he seemed to perk up . // Tavey bowed to the king . " My mistress has just awakened , and , learning of your need , has told me to tell you she will be here in the third hour after the dawn tomorrow . " // " Thank her for me , and tell her I eagerly await her coming , " the king replied . Then he fell back among his pillows , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hourglass . The purple sand was almost all gone now . When the last grain of it dropped from the top to the bottom it would turn silver , and the king would die . He bowed again , and backed out of the chamber . // Cinnia went to her father 's side . " You can not die before this is decided , " she said . " It is tradition . And you can not die before you have passed your authority to your successor . That , too , is tradition on Belmair. " // " I have almost waited too long , " Fflergant said weakly . " My pride could not admit to the fact that I was getting old , Daughter . But my time is very close now . I heard your mother singing again in my dreams last night . She is waiting for me. " // " And you will be with her soon enough , Father , " Cinnia said softly , her eyes welling with tears . " But do not leave me until you have met this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's next king . " // " There can be no delay , " the king told his daughter . " Once he is chosen and brought to the castle , the marriage must take place . My last breath as king will be his first breath as king . That is also tradition , Cinnia. " // The young woman nodded . " I chafe against it , but I will not break with tradition , Father . I will not be like those exiled from us so long ago , " she promised him . // " I am relieved to hear it , " the old king said with some small humor . " I know how difficult it is for you , my daughter , for you are not a woman to sit by her loom weaving contentedly . Nidhug has taught you well , and you are a great sorceress. " // " I show promise , the dragon says , " Cinnia responded with a chuckle . // " I wonder who she will choose to follow me , " the old king said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daughter ? " // The young woman considered , and then she shook her head . " I can name no one I would choose to follow you , Father . Unless there is someone in one of the three provinces I do not know of , I can think of none . Its dukes are ancient , and long wed . " // " Memory fails me , Daughter . Do any have sons ? " the old king asked . // " Only Dreng of Beltran , " Cinnia answered , " but he is long wed . " // " How odd , " the old king said thoughtfully . " In a time when a king is needed it would appear there is none to be had . " // " Perhaps tradition is about to change , " Cinnia suggested mischievously , " and a queen will follow you . " // " If that be so , " replied her father , " the queen still needs a husband if she is to produce the next king . Even all your sorcery can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " We can make all the suppositions we want to make , " Cinnia said . " Only the dragon can tell us what is to come , Father . Even I acknowledge that . I am sorry she did not come tonight , but I know how hungry she is after one of her little naps . She must eat before she can consider the solution to our problem . " // And Nidhug was indeed enjoying her evening feast . She praised the cook lavishly for her presence of mind in including the poultry offerings . " No one , Sarabeth , " she said to the cook , " can roast a goose as you do . " She popped a whole bird into her mouth , crunching down upon it , her thin tongue whipping out to lick her lips . " Delicious ! " Nidhug pronounced as she swallowed the goose . " And capon , too ! Is it stuffed ? " // " Of course , mistress , and with that apple and walnut stuffing you so like , " the cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion to include a bit of poultry . " I only did two of them , but I roasted two ducks in the plum sauce you favor , as well , " Sarabeth told the dragon . // " Excellent ! " the dragon said . " I shall need all my strength tomorrow , for the king is not an easy man to deal with , I fear . " // When the dragon had finished her meal she went up upon the battlements of her castle and stretched to her full height . Then unfolding her delicate wings she rose up into the night sky . Belmair possessed twin moons . One of silver , one of gold . Their phases were identical , and tonight they shone in their first quarter , lighting the landscape below her as she flew . Peace flowed through the dragon 's veins as she looked down . // Belmair was not a large world . It consisted of four islands of varying size set in a great sea . The largest island , which bore the name of Belmair , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller islands of Beldane , Belia and Beltran . Beldane was a lovely land of valleys , gentle hills and glens . Belia was mountainous . Beltran consisted mostly of great tracts of forest and meadows . Each province was ruled over by a ducal family , and each duke answered to the king . // The kings of Belmair did not always follow a familial succession . From the beginnings of time as far back as the Belmairans could remember , it was a dragon who had chosen the king from among the ducal families . And if the preceding king had a daughter of marriageable age the new king was required to wed her . // Once many centuries back , a king designate had been betrothed to a woman he loved when he had been chosen to be king . The betrothed maiden was willing to step aside for her beloved 's sake for no one chosen by the dragon to be Belmair 's king could refuse the honor . The previous king 's daughter was willing to give up her place for she saw the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a maiden with a kind heart . The dragon settled the matter by sitting both maidens in a pen filled with peas . Somewhere among the peas was a pearl . Whoever found the pearl would be the king 's bride . The rumor was that the princess , finding the pearl first , surreptitiously pushed it into the other girl 's view thus giving up her place . The dragon , who knew all , saw the princess married to the young duke of Beltran , who was also in need of a wife , and blessed her with healthy children and many happy years with her husband to reward her for her good and thoughtful heart . // The dragon stopped to rest herself upon a mountaintop in the duchy of Belia . It was spring , and the snows were melting . The sea surrounding the island , visible from her perch , sparkled in the dappled moonlight . She closed her eyes briefly and breathed deeply of the fresh mountain air . There had been but one Great Dragon of Belmair before her-her father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Dragon , but as she had yet had the inclination to raise a hatchling , she knew she would continue her watch over Belmair into the distant future . // The problem before her was to choose a successor for King Fflergant . But there was no successor here on Belmair . She knew each ducal family , and she knew all the men in those ducal families . But none of those males was the next king . She might have changed tradition and chosen Cinnia to be Belmair 's queen . But Cinnia , while a great sorceress although Nidhug would never tell her so , was not capable of ruling Belmair no matter what the girl thought . // " Greetings , Nidhug . How beautiful you are in the moonlight , " an elegant voice said , and then Kaliq , the great Shadow Prince of Hetar , laughed as the dragon 's eyes flew open with her surprise to see him standing before her . // " My lord Kaliq , I greet you in friendship , " Nidhug told him . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him to Belmair ? She had not seen him in at least a thousand years . Kaliq of the Shadows did not come casually . There was a purpose to his visit . And to come at this particular time ? He had intrigued her as he always did . // " The purple sands in Fflergant 's glass are almost gone , " Kaliq began . " You need a king , and there is no king at this time here in Belmair , is there ? " // The dragon shook her head . " Nay , there is no one , my lord Kaliq. " // " That is because Belmair 's new king is in my palace , Nidhug , " the prince said . // " He is Hetarian ? " This could not be ! // " He is my son , " the Shadow Prince surprised the dragon by saying . " His mother is called Lara . She is the daughter of Ilona , queen of the Forest Faeries in Hetar , and of a Hetarian called John Swiftsword . Lara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first husband , Vartan of the Fiacre . We were once lovers long ago , and I told her that we Shadow Princes no longer reproduced . But how could I deny myself the joy of having a son with her for she was perfect . I left my seed in Lara , and when she was ready to give Vartan a child that seed bloomed . I saw to it that the boy had Vartan 's coloring , and when people looked at him as a boy they saw Vartan through the magic with which I surrounded him . " // Kaliq chuckled . " Lara has always thought Dillon gained his magic through her and her faerie blood . But he has my blood , too . He came to me for training when he was twelve . He is now twenty-two , and a great sorcerer . The perfect king for Belmair , and the perfect mate for the fair Cinnia , the sorceress of Belmair. " // " She is a great sorceress , " Nidhug said proudly . " I have taught her myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know , my lord Kaliq. " // " He was not born in Hetar , nor has he ever lived there . He was born in the Outlands into the Clan Fiacre . He was raised by the Fiacre , and later in Terah by his mother and his stepfather , Magnus Hauk , its Dominus . And for almost half his life he has lived with me. " // Nidhug nodded , but then she said , " For all its lands with their differences it is still considered the world of Hetar , and the boy 's grandsire was Hetarian. " // " With faerie blood in his veins , as well , " Kaliq responded . // " Trust me , Nidhug . Dillon is meant to be Belmair 's new king and Cinnia 's husband . " // " Show him to me , " the dragon said quietly . // The prince held out his palm , and blew into it until a large iri-descent bubble had formed itself into a perfect sphere . Then he gently waved his hand over it . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with dark hair and blue eyes . He sat on a bench in earnest conversation with a lovely young girl while three young children played about them . " Who are the others ? " Nidhug asked . // " The girl he speaks with is his sister , Anoush , daughter of Vartan . The other three are Magnus Hauk 's offspring . The older girl is Zagiri , and the twins are Taj and Marzina. " // " The twins are quite dissimilar , " the dragon noted . " Yes , " the prince replied . " Kol , the Twilight Lord , caught Lara on the Dream Plain , and implanted his seed within her . As her husband had just gotten her with child that seed quickly took root , and the children were born together , and assumed to be twins . " // " I thought Kol was imprisoned , " the dragon said . // " He is now , " Kaliq told her . " And he has been forbidden from the Dream Plain for what he did there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting family whose blood you would mix into Belmair , " she said drily . She peered more closely . The young man was fair of face and sturdy of form . Was he strong enough , however , to rule both Belmair and its sorceress ? " Can he wield the power of a Belmairan king firmly ? He looks to be a gentle man . But he can not be ! You are asking me to introduce a stranger into Belmair as its new king . The ducal families will not be pleased by a decision such as this . " // " Only Dreng of Beltran has a son , " Kaliq said . " And he is married . " // " But all three dukes have grandsons , " the dragon pointed out . // " Most are not old enough to be king , and the two who are could not control Cinnia , " the great Shadow Prince said quietly . " Fflergant 's sands will be gone in less than three days , Nidhug . Do you think I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son on a purely sentimental whim . " // " Does he know ? " the dragon asked candidly. // " He will before he comes to Belmair , " Kaliq answered her . " I believe he has suspected it , though , for the last few years . " // " And his mother ? " // Kaliq smiled . " In time , Nidhug . Lara has only partly fulfilled the destiny that was planned for her . In time she will , but for now it is Belmair 's future we must concern ourselves with .

Then there was a sound at the door and eight cops burst in , shouting to get down , waving batons , throwing kids to the floor , saying , not to fucking move . A minute after that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frisked , pushed around , while neighbors stuck their heads out of doors , shook their fingers , saying " Always up to no good , these kids . Gone wild . " Rutkovsky talked to a cop with curly black hair , a gap between his teeth , a black mustache and a single gold earring . His name was Pastori . This cop walked over to the reflector shades guy , knocked the shades off his face , and stepped on them . He gripped the guy behind the neck and poked him in the chest with two fingers . " You want a shot at him ? " he yelled over his shoulder . Rutkovsky shook his head , and said , " How ' bout you , Cross ? You want a shot ? " // " A shot ? " I said . // Rutkovsky and Pastori looked at each other and they both laughed . // An umbilical cord is thick as your finger . Two veins and one artery spiral together , the veins blue and the artery pinkish-a hose rushing blood from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's spongy and tough . You can feel a pulse if you hold the cord near the belly . To cut it , you need something sturdy and sharp , like scissors , a knife , or a piece of broken glass . // We drove along the stark , grim line of the Polo Grounds projects , past the basketball courts surrounded with chain-link fences and the playground with the swings missing , and arrived at the base of the northernmost tower , where a crowd jostled each other , pointing thirty floors up to the roof , then down to some lump on the concrete . An EMT stood nearby holding a curved piece of flesh the size of a hockey puck between two fingers . As we jumped out of the ambulance the EMT said , " What the fuck is this ? What part of the body ? " Without even slowing Rutkovsky said , " Hard palate . Knocked it right out when she hit . " // The girl had cracked the pavement , indenting it . One leg was bent backward beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was completely still . Rutkovsky stood over her , studying the position she was in , looking up at the roof , then back at her . He bent and felt her neck and the back of her skull and lifted her shirt to examine her torso and saw what she 'd done before she jumped-in rough , scraggly , red letters , the words LIFE SUCKS were carved into her belly . Rutkovsky stood there looking for about ten seconds . Then , without changing his expression , he checked his watch and turned and said , " Six forty-three . " A cop behind us wrote the time down . Rutkovsky took a sheet from the stretcher and spread it over the girl , tucking the edges in so it would not blow away . We left her with the EMTs , who had less training than the medics and always had to wait with the dead bodies . Rutkovsky and I walked back to the ambulance . The whole thing had taken three minutes . On the dashboard of the ambulance Rutkovsky 's dinner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front seat , picked up his plastic fork , and had started eating again when a middle-aged woman walked up and watched us from ten feet away , stepping from foot to foot . When Rutkovsky glanced at her it was like she was stung . She screamed , " Look at him ! He 'd rather eat than save my daughter . Eating sesame chicken while my daughter 's dying ! " // She ran up and smacked the side window , her distorted face behind glass . // " My daughter 's dead ! He 's eating sesame fucking chicken ! " // Rutkovsky placed his food on the dashboard , started the engine , blared the horn once , and when the dead girl 's mother stepped back , Rutkovsky let his foot off the brake . We rolled down the block . He turned the corner , parked , picked up his food , and went on eating , all without a word . I looked at him . Rutkovsky lowered his fork . // " What ? " he said . // " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she wanted us to work her up . I mean , so she knew nothing was left untried . " // Rutkovsky did n't explain that we could n't waste a medic unit working up every hopeless patient . He did n't say that the system was stretched thin as it was and we 'd get in trouble for wasting our time on a dead patient . All he said was , " Like I was going to try to save her . I was eating my dinner . " // " More than a good station or a good tour you 'll want a good partner . Your partner will be your real teacher and he 'll determine whether the job is tolerable . It 's one of the first things you learn on the job . Fuck everyone else . Fuck the patient . Get along with your partner . " // A half-dissected cadaver lay on a steel table , the interior cavity of the body exposed , the organs visible , the grayish formaldehyde pooled in the folds of the plastic wrapping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brains , kidneys , fetuses , and encephalopathic babies . I was in the A and P lab at Weill Medical School , which is a part of Cornell University and is on the Upper East Side . I was standing over Clara 's cadaver while she prodded the gall bladder with forceps , and said things like " Can you hand me that scalpel , Ollie ? " or " Cut there , will you ? " Tall , slim , matter-of-fact , Clara had dark , straight hair that went all the way down her back and that she tied up and folded under a blue cap . There was something prim and proper and a little restrained about her . She was a member of every club in college , got A 's , always handed everything in on time . Organized , diligent Clara . She wanted to be a surgeon by the age of thirty and she let everyone know it . I was standing at the foot of her cadaver , studying with her , listening to her lecture me a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other students wandered past . One of these students , a friend of Clara 's said to me , " What year are you ? " // " I 'm not in school here . I 'm a paramedic. " // " Ah , cool , " the friend said in a different tone , and seemed more at ease after that . // " He was my lab partner in college , " Clara said without looking up . " He 's taking a year off . He 's going to med school next year . " // " If I get in , " I said , and Clara went on prodding at the gall bladder , not looking at me , but I could tell she was annoyed at my answer . By the way she clacked the scalpel down on the steel counter afterward I could see she was n't happy . We heard her friend 's footsteps go off into the hallway and fade . Without looking up , Clara said , " Just tell her you 're going to school , Ollie . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when . " // " I 'll say ' when ' when it happens . Not before . We both know it might not happen . " // Clara held her mouth shut tightly and went on prodding at the cadaver , not saying anything . // An old Dominican guy was lying on a picnic bench near the lighthouse beneath the George Washington Bridge , his legs hanging off the end of the bench so you could see his white socks above his old brown loafers . A nebulizer rested in the grass , and an old Dominican woman nearby shouted , " Asthmatica , asthmatica ! Ayudame ! Asthmatica ! " When I touched the guy it upset the balance and he slid off the bench and landed in a lump in the grass . His chest heaved once , and then he lay there , eyes glazed , staring up at me . He was too weak to move . // " Showtime , " Rutkovsky said . // He tossed me the tube kit and as I set up the laryngoscope Rutkovsky forced air in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I gave Rutkovsky a pleading look , like , you do this one , but he said , " You got ta learn sometime , Cross . " // " Not on this guy . He 's dying . " // " Cross , " he said , and just by the way he said it I knew he would n't take no for an answer . I lined up behind the head , set the laryngoscope up , and went in with the scope , trying to find the vocal cords . I could n't see them . I tried to force air in with the BVM . I could n't squeeze the bag . The airway was shut completely . I tried with the scope again , still could n't see the cords , and when I looked up I saw a swaggering , thick-necked medic named LaFontaine hurrying across the grassy field . He was smiling as he lumbered on . // " What is this , amateur night ? " he bellowed. // " He 's got ta learn , " Rutkovsky said . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Rutkovsky. // " Look again . " // " He 'll die . " // " Look again . " // " He 's dying , " I said . // LaFontaine tossed his equipment at the patient 's feet . He grinned at me , and in a know it all tone , said , " He 'll definitely die if you sit there not doin ' nothin ' . " // I could hear the beeping of each heartbeat on the monitor . It was in the forties , and slowing . The wife and daughter stood to the side , clinging to each other , the daughter holding white mittens tightly in one hand , sniffling and wiping her eyes with the back of her hand . I could feel the cold , moist grass at my knees . I could hear the traffic going over the seams on the George Washington Bridge above us . Rutkovsky and LaFontaine both looked at me , waiting . There was nothing else to do . I gripped the scope again and went in and tried to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I found the cords . They were completely shut . There was no airhole between them . That 's why I had n't been able to see them before . I pulled the scope out . The heart rate had dipped beneath forty . // " I ca n't do it , Rut . He 'll die . The cords are spasmed shut . " // Rutkovsky just tilted his head and made a clicking sound . Silent dismissal . LaFontaine was grinning , but Rutkovsky did n't look at him . Rutkovsky snatched the laryngoscope from me , pushed me aside , and knelt behind the head . He carefully slid the scope into the mouth . He repositioned himself . He looked for a long time . He seemed alert , but not nervous . The heart rate was now in the low thirties . He was still waiting . // " Come here , Cross , " he said . " I want you to see this . " // I got behind the patient 's head . The guy was n't moving at all now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Rutkovsky gave me the tube with one hand while he held the scope in place with the other . I bent to look . // " Those are the cords , " he said . " The two white lines . Remember what they look like . Remember how to find them . " // " But they 're clamped shut . " // " Yeah , just wait , " he said . // We waited . And waited . And waited . Then the guy 's chest heaved once , probably for the last time , and the vocal cords eased open momentarily . // " Now ! " Rutkovsky hissed . // I stabbed inward with the tube . A moment later Rutkovsky was listening with his stethoscope , making sure the tube was positioned correctly . LaFontaine scowled at me. // " Way to go , Cross . Excellent patient care . " // " Thanks , Rut , " I said , but he shrugged , said nothing , and went on squeezing the BVM , breathing for the guy . // As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart rate went up into the sixties and then over a hundred . By the time we were in the ER the guy was awake and trying to pull the tube out . We 'd definitely saved his life . No doubt about it . He 'd practically coded in front of us . And now , ten minutes later , he was sitting up trying to pull the tube out . // Afterward , cleaning up in the ER bay , I tried to act like it was a normal thing-saving a life-like it was something I did everyday , like I was n't impressed with what we 'd done . It was useless . I could n't hide it . I felt pretty fucking good . I mean , we 'd just saved the guy 's life ! LaFontaine grinned at Rutkovsky. // " You should 've let the patient code . Teach Cross a lesson . " // " What lesson would that teach me ? " I said . // " If you miss your tubes your patients die . " // Station 18 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street from Harlem Hospital . The station occupied a part of the old Nurses Residence , a four-story , dirty brick building with streaked white stains beneath the ledges and surrounded by a listing chain-link fence with razor wire on top . There was an oxygen cage with a padlock to the west of the building and next to that a compressed-oxygen tank that would be covered in frost when it was filled up . There were always bloodstained longboards leaning against the brick walls and all manner of medical garbage blown up against the fence and around the base of the building : old rubber gloves , plastic wrap from gauze four-by-fours , used c-spine collars , medication packaging , bloody bandages , balled medical tape , anything you could imagine . A narrow pathway between two boarded-up buildings led to 137th Street and the EMS parking lot , which was just a gravel square with a sliding gate on a street where steerers for the drug dealers hung out on the stoops. // The day after we treated the asthmatic , as I made the turn at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station , I saw a bunch of medics standing out front in the afternoon sunlight watching me walk up . It was Rutkovsky , LaFontaine , and a bunch of medics I did n't know at the time . I wished I had n't tucked my shirt in . I wished I was n't carrying my MCAT book or wearing my Northwestern hat . They all shifted as I got close and looked away . I said hey and walked on and by the way they smiled as I passed I knew something was up . I went down to my locker and found a taped sketch of the grim reaper on my locker . I guess a joke had started up about how I 'd tried to miss my tube with the asthmatic on purpose , how I wanted the guy to die , how I got off on dead patients . As I walked back up to the lobby LaFontaine asked if I was going to try to kill any more patients , if I enjoyed it , if I was interning at the morgue . // @ @ @ @ @ 
@@4022242 One // Oneiros Intelligence Services . The name on the door greeted Shea as she stepped off the elevator . As always , a shiver of excitement ran through her veins . The warm rush was pleasurable , but the dull ache in her head was n't . Neither was the tight band of tension around her chest . Nervously , she brushed her hand down her skirt . // Maybe she should have rescheduled . This meeting was important , but she was n't feeling very well . After last night 's ... incident she had n't been able to get back to sleep . She had n't even tried . It had been all she could do just to keep the panic at bay . Even now , if she breathed too deeply , she 'd touch upon that dark fear . // So she was n't breathing deeply . // And she was n't thinking about last night . // She was here to do her job , and was glad for the distraction . She always felt like she had to be on top of her game whenever she came here . // Or anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going down ? // The unexpected question made her flinch so hard , her briefcase bounced against her knee . " Excuse me ? " she asked , turning on the heel of her white slingback. // A balding executive reached out and pushed the button for the elevator . " Are you heading down ? " he repeated . // " Oh ! No . " Heat rose up into her face . " Thanks anyway . " Embarrassed , she stepped forward , gripped the handle under the stenciled sign , and determinedly pushed the heavy wooden door inward . Plush carpeting silenced her footsteps as she crossed the office suite to the receptionist 's desk . " Good morning , Ellen . " // " Good morning , Ms. Caldwell . " The brunette rose from her chair and gestured to the office on her left . " Mr. Oneiros has been expecting you . Can I get you anything ? Coffee ? Tea ? " // " Coffee would be wonderful . " Anything with caffeine . Absently , Shea swept her hand along her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone down . Now if only she could get her sluggish brain moving . " Cream with two sugars , please . " // An infusion of glucose could n't hurt , either . // " I 'll bring it to you as soon as the pot is finished brewing , " the receptionist replied . " Please , go right on in. " // " Thank you . " Tightening her grip on her briefcase , Shea turned toward the private office . She did n't know why she was so tense about this meeting ; she worked with Derek all the time . He was the best at what he did . Yet he also challenged her . The man was just an uncanny mixture of GQ and genius . // " Get it together , " she whispered softly under her breath . // She could n't let him see her so unsettled . If he saw for a moment that she was weak or off-kilter , he 'd have questions ... or he 'd be concerned . Her forehead rumpled . Now where had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a quick knock on the door . She 'd just give him the assignment and leave . Her gray matter was n't up to much more than that today . // " Come in. " // The deep , smooth timbre of his voice was surprisingly calming . Some of the tightness inside her unkinked , and she took the deepest breath she 'd managed all day . Letting it out slowly , she opened the door . He was already halfway across the room , coming to greet her . // " Shea , " he said , holding out his hand . // Automatically , she caught it in a handshake . " Derek . " // His hand swallowed hers , his tough skin brushing intimately against her softer flesh . Inwardly , Shea sighed in pleasure . She may have hired the man for his intelligence , but she was n't a nun . His GQ appeal was why she always conducted their business in person . // Confused by the direction of her thoughts , she pulled her hand back . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . Instead , his thumb dragged across the back of her fingers as if he did n't want to let her go . She looked up and found him staring at her . // A frown wrinkled his brow . " What 's wrong ? " // Her stomach took a dangerous dip , and her mouth went dry . So much for hiding anything from him . // Reaching out , he ran a fingertip along her temple . " Headache ? " // She blinked when she felt her eyes unexpectedly sting . If only that was the extent of her problems . She felt panic start bubbling up , seeking escape and comfort , but she forced it back down . He was just being polite . " Do I look that bad ? " // A derisive sound left the back of his throat . " As if you could . " // He caught her by the elbow and directed her toward one of the chairs in front of his desk . " Sit down . Can I get you anything ? Aspirin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sound like such a bad idea . Shea gratefully sank into the oversize leather chair . " I 'm fine , " she said as she set her briefcase on the floor beside her . // Her tension level shot back up , though , when she came upright and found him way too close . Instead of taking his own chair behind the desk , he 'd settled his hips against the sturdy oak . His impeccable gray suit creased as he folded his arms across his chest and looked at her steadily . " Do n't lie . I can see the pain in your eyes . " She licked her tongue across the back of her dry lips . She 'd always found Derek an incredibly attractive man , but the way he was hovering over her made him seem bigger . Stronger . And with her emotions so close to the surface , all this fussing was making her downright ... aware . // " It 's not that bad , " she insisted . // " I can pull the shades . " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inappropriate direction . // " If it 's too bright , " he clarified . // The heat settled in her cheeks . What was wrong with her ? " No need , " she said , rubbing her palms against the smooth leather covering the arms of the chair . " Your receptionist is bringing me coffee . That should do the trick . " // The lines on his forehead only deepened . " Caffeine withdrawal ? " // Shea crossed her legs . On the job , Derek 's tenacity was a distinct plus . Personally , though , it was disconcerting to be on the receiving end of that laserlike focus . " It was just a long night . " // Silence fell upon the room and , too late , she realized the impression she must have given him . " Oh , no . Not that ! I had trouble sleeping . " // " Insomnia ? " The question came out so quickly , he nearly spoke over her . // The reason for his concern became clear , and Shea suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't care whether or not she 'd had anight of hot , never-ending sex . It was her lack of sleep . The entire city had recently endured an epidemic of sorts . For reasons unknown , people had gone through weeks without REM sleep . Unable to experience the recuperative power of the dream state , the victims had suffered terribly . And Derek 's brother , Cael , had nearly been killed by a dream-deprived woman . // " It was just one bad night , " she said . // She watched as his fingers wrapped around the beveled edge of the desk . One bad night or not , he was concerned . Impulsively , she reached out and laid her hand across the back of his white knuckles . // " I promise . " // " Are you sure ? " " I 'm fine , Derek . " She gave his fingers a soft squeeze . " I 've been dreaming . Lots and lots of dreams . " // That seemed to settle him somewhat . He looked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised when he turned his hand and caught her fingers between his thumb and palm . The contact sent a thrill through her . When she searched his eyes , though , his dark brown gaze looked haunted and uneasy . // " How is your brother ? " she asked softly . // The question seemed to hang in midair . For a moment , Shea thought she 'd crossed the line . As much as they 'd worked together , she really did n't know Derek all that well . She had no right to be asking questions about his family , but he was worrying her . // A muscle ticked along his jaw . " He 's better . " // " Is he out of the hospital ? " // " He 's staying with his girlfriend . " He looked down at her hand in his . With a soft touch , he aligned their palms more fully . " Cael 's getting stir-crazy , though . Devon 's going to have a fight on her hands if she tries to keep him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That sounds good , " Shea said , trying to find her voice . The way he was holding her hand was doing funny things inside her chest . " Is n't it ? " // " Yeah , " he said absently . " It 's good . " // " So why are n't you more relieved ? " // He moved their hands to his thigh . It was the look he gave her , though , that stopped her inclination to squirm . One look , and she was pinned . // " Why could n't you sleep ? " // For a split second , she was thrown right back into last night . Into her basement , into the dark . Cold fear knotted her gut , and the panic collided with the breath in her throat . His hold on her hand tightened , pulling her back into the present . Into the daylight and into the professional workplace ... // Shea slammed a lid on her emotions and smoothed her face . " It was just one of those things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // She forced a smile onto her lips and gave a firm tug on her hand . " I 'm happy to hear that your brother is doing so well . I know that your family has been through a lot . " // " Shea , " he said , refusing to let her go . // " Derek . " She was n't going to wrestle with him , but she wanted her hand back . Now . A knock on the door saved her , and she looked at him pointedly . " That must be my coffee . " // Derek stared down at Shea . Something was wrong ; he could see it . He could feel it . // " Mr. Oneiros ? " // Hell . // " Come in , Ellen , " he called . As much as he did n't want to , he dropped his client 's hand . Pushing himself away from the desk , he circled it before his assistant could get ideas . // " Here 's your coffee , Ms. Caldwell , " Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shea replied . // Funny how he knew she was n't referring to the hot drink . // The china tinkled as his receptionist placed the cup and saucer onto the desk . " Can I get either of you anything else ? " // A few ideas entered Derek 's mind , but he kept them to himself . " Thank you , Ellen . That will be all . " // Leaning back against the filing cabinet , he watched Shea speculatively . That had been fear he 'd seen in her eyes -- raw , unfiltered fear . // The idea that she was having sleep problems bothered him a little too much . // He watched as she picked up the coffee cup . He knew he was staring , but that was inevitable . The woman was just ... perfect . There was no other way to describe her . With that blond hair and tight , sleek body , she was gorgeous . That brain of hers was a major turn-on , too . // But something was different today . // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a lifeline . Her hands looked dainty and fine . When they shook and the cup tinkled against the saucer , he pinpointed the difference . // Today , she seemed vulnerable . // He raked a hand through his hair . He 'd never seen her in anything but top form . What had happened last night ? // " Ah , that tastes wonderful , " she said , settling back into her chair . // He pushed himself away from the cabinet and made himself sit down , too . " I hope it helps . " // She wanted to keep things between them businesslike , but sleep was his business . She did n't know it -- and never would -- but he had a vested interest in her dreams . In everyone 's dreams , he quickly chastised himself . They were his family 's domain ; their responsibility and charge . // He and his brothers were the Oneiroi , modern-day Dream Wreakers . Descended from Greek gods , it was their job to bestow dreams upon sleeping humans . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream realm to do their work . // Yet they 'd failed recently , and failed miserably . // The incident with Cael and Devon had opened a door that should have remained closed . He and his brothers were still cleaning up the mess . But even the slimmest possibility that Shea was somehow feeling the repercussions made him ill. // Pushing her on the issue obviously was n't going to work , though . " How are things at Biodermatics ? " he asked . // " Very well , thank you . We 're quite busy these days . " // Busy enough that she was losing sleep ? // " I see that you 've landed Audrey Lowe as a spokesperson . That 's quite the accomplishment. " // " It does n't hurt to have a celebrity endorse your skin care products . We 're already seeing an increase in sales . " // And obviously an increase in headaches . He did n't think she realized it when she reached up to rub her temple , but he did . // He let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a tendency to do that whenever she came around : react . One sleepless night did n't necessarily mean that something was wrong . A neighbor 's dog could have yapped all night . Maybe the summer heat had bothered her . // Unfortunately , neither of those explanations accounted for the stiff set of her shoulders or the lines of tension around her mouth . That soft , pink , kissable mouth ... // " How is the intelligence business ? " she asked . // He flicked open the notepad in the center of his desk with his forefinger . " You really do n't want to know . " // Opening the top desk drawer , he pulled out a pen . His company specialized in corporate intelligence , data mining , and information security . These days , it was difficult to keep up with the hackers , white-collar criminals , and scam artists . // " You mentioned on the phone that you wanted a background check done , " he said gruffly . " Are you hiring a new research scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coffee aside , she reached for her briefcase. // The movement pulled at her white suit jacket , and his gaze fell on the vee neckline in a decidedly unbusinesslike manner . She was wearing one of those close-fitting , tailored suits that made a man wonder what lay underneath . A bra strap ... something lacy ... skin ? // Skin . // His body started to hum . The tiny diamond pendant of her necklace swung to the side , though , and glinted at him in warning . Letting out a quick breath , he shifted in his chair . // " Phillip and I decided we need another secretary . " // Phillip . Even with the warning , Derek was n't prepared for the cold dash of water that was thrown over his libido . His pen poked a hole in the paper , and he grimaced . Ripping it off the tablet , he crumpled it and threw it in the trash. // " Tamika is great , but there 's just too much work for one person , " Shea continued as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really need someone to assist each of us. " // Us . His hand fisted around his pen . Whatever had spooked her last night , good old Phil had certainly been there to take care of her . // The feel of her gaze on him made Derek tear his thoughts away from the unwanted visions in his head -- visions of Shea and her too-good-looking partner . He looked at the manila folder in her hand and tried to think . // " A secretary , " he said dubiously . // " Yes . " She glanced up as she put her briefcase back on the floor . " Why ? " // Saying nothing , he opened the file . The applicant 's rsum sat on top , and he gave it a quick once-over . The facts entered his head on autopilot , for his mind was already churning over other things . // Like maybe he 'd been onto something with his original work stress idea . // Tapping his finger on the corner of the file , he shot her a look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " // " You 've made a breakthrough . " // He had to give her credit . Other than a slight widening of her eyes , she did n't give anything away . It piqued his interest even more . // " Things are going a bit better with my research , " she admitted , smoothing the edge of her skirt over her knee . // He watched her closely . She was always so careful when she talked about her work . Part of it was humility , but there was something else .... Sometimes he almost got the feeling she did n't want to jinx anything . // And he understood why . The implications of her research could be so far-reaching .... // Skin care products were Biodermatics 's primary market , but Shea 's personal efforts were focused on the medical dermatological market . Specifically , she was working toward better treatments for burn victims . Very few people knew that , and she paid him good money to keep it that way . Even under a confidentiality agreement , she 'd only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the pressure had to be there . The stress could be getting to her , and stress could do bad things to sleep patterns . // Derek leaned forward onto his elbows . " You 've never had me do this thorough a background check for a low-level employee before . " // " I think we need to change that . " // " Okay , " he said slowly . " I 'll get on it . " // A shy smile of thanks pulled at her lips , and he felt his cock harden . Oh , yeah . Major breakthrough . The woman was smart , classy , and devastatingly sexy . // No wonder she was taken . // Rubbing the back of his neck , he glanced down to the rsum . " So , Lynette Fromm , " he read . " What do you think of her ? " // Shea cleared her throat . " She seems bright and enthusiastic . She 's called several times expressing interest in the position . " // " But ? " // She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times expressing interest in the position . " // He made a quick note . " Got it . " // He skimmed through the information . " She has strong computer skills . " // " And a degree in chemistry , so she should pick up on the technical lingo pretty quickly . " // " There 's a two-year break in her work history . " // " She claimed she was taking care of an ill parent . " // He flipped to the page of notes she 'd taken . As expected , they were meticulous . " Her references seem to check out . " // " But applicants always list people who will give them good recommendations . You taught me that . " // He closed the file and set his pen atop it . Everything seemed straightforward enough -- except she had his brain scattered all over the place . // " This should n't take long , " he said . " Is there anything else you want me to check into ? " // " That 's it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " All right . Do you want me to call you with what I find , or should I drop by your offices ? " // She blinked as if he 'd surprised her . He became even more curious when she blushed . // " You can stop by the lab , " she said after a moment . " That 's where I 'm spending most of my time these days . " // He nodded .

It was two in the morning ; his investigator , Jerry Freemont , was three hours late , and prayer alone was not calming his nerves . // The doorbell rang . Whipple rushed into the foyer , but he did not find his investigator standing on his front stoop when he opened the door . Instead , an elegantly dressed man , wearing an old school tie from Whipple 's alma mater , smiled at him . The senator 's visitor was of medium build and height . He wore his sandy hair slicked down ; wire-rimmed glasses perched on a Roman nose .

The lawyer leaned back , crossing his right leg over his left to expose freshly polished wingtips. // " It 's Mr. Freemont , " Northwood said . " He 's not coming . " // Whipple was confused . The lawyer looked solemn . " He was a fine investigator , Senator . He found the memo proving that several biotech companies contributed millions to a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-cloning bill .

" You 're expecting your investigator to bring you the key to your presidential nomination , and I show up instead . " He dipped his head in mock sympathy . " But surely you did n't think that my principals would just stand by quietly while you put us out of business ? " // The lawyer 's condescension sparked Whipple 's anger .

I want you to know that . It took several hours to convince him to tell us where he was hiding the evidence . " Whipple was stunned . The photograph showed a man , barely recognizable as Jerry Freemont , suspended in air by a length of chain that bound his wrists . It was impossible to tell where the shot had been taken , but the bare beams and peaked roof suggested a barn . Only Freemont 's torso and head were visible in the shot , but the cuts and burns on his body could be seen clearly . // " Not a pretty sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that my clients are very serious when they say that they will stop at nothing to achieve their ends .

Whipple 's features suffused with rage , and his muscles bunched for action . Then he froze . Northwood was pointing a gun at his heart . // " Sit , " he said . Whipple hesitated for a moment . Northwood dropped two more photographs on the coffee table . The blood drained from the senator 's face . // " Your wife is a very handsome woman , and your granddaughter looks charming .

He slumped back onto his chair . // " If you do as we say , you and your family will be safe . " // " What do you want ? " Whipple asked . He sounded completely defeated . Northwood stood up . " Twenty years is a long time to be in politics , Senator . Maybe this would be a good time to retire so you can spend more time with your family .

I was disappointed because I was looking forward to spending time with my folks . // I reluctantly opened up the front door and about thirty people yelled , " Congratulations !

I was different because I knocked down chicks for free . // Then years later , I ran into her at the West Mall off of Paxton Boulevard . I told myself at that moment she 'd be my number one .

It warmed her hand with its radiance . The pure , soft , and deep yellow metal had been sought for centuries for its symbolic and real value . // Only the movement of the truck broke her trance .

He glanced at her , his blue eyes resting only a moment on hers before he looked away and slid the coin into his pocket . // Sophie knew there was no turning back .

She rolled up the sleeves of her shirt as far as she could , but sweat still glistened on her skin . She brushed back damp hair from her cheek and scanned the roadside for any sign of life . It seemed important to get her mind off the urgent . To let her worries dissipate the way the dust behind the truck tires settled after they passed . // It was no use .

And the silence of the man on either side of her told Sophie her concerns were not unique . // She glanced at Philip . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only inches separated them on the seat of the large cargo truck , the wall of tension seemed too much to penetrate .

She hoped so . If anyone could take them to safety and get the gold into the hands of those who would make sure the people of Spain benefited , it would be Walt . // If they succeeded in transporting the gold safely across the borders , to the hands of eager collectors , it meant more funds to buy arms .

Who would put another person through such Fain to save his own skin-or more accurately , his own hunt for treasure ? // There was a time she 'd believed Michael loved her , but obviously that was n't the case .

" // Walt cleared his throat and glanced at her for the briefest moment . " Yes , there is danger . But perhaps the sensation is due to something more . " // Sophie glanced at Walt 's fingers as they tightened around the steering wheel . " What do you mean ? All that I 'm worried about is n't enough ? Is there more danger I should know about ? " // Sophie felt Philip tense next to her . He 'd been silent most of the trip , but from the way he crossed his arms over his chest and set his chin , she knew he was n't happy . The worst part was knowing she 'd caused his pain . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe , " Walt continued , ignoring Sophie 's question . " They made up legends and myths to make sense of the world-the Greeks with their myths , the Jews with their stories about God . The Aztec nations paid a lot of attention to omens . If the moon was red before a battle , they believed the blood of their enemies would flow . They looked for signs of danger ahead and worried their actions would be displeasing to the gods . I imagine when they saw this gold they felt the same as we do . " Walt sighed . " I can imagine them shuddering with each step , wondering if they were making the right moves . " // " And if they 'd be struck down with lightning if they were n't ? " Philip scoffed . // " Or captured before nightfall ? " Sophie studied the road ahead intently . A chill moved up her arms , and she wished she had n't held the coin or looked into its eyes . " Of course , I do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did , then surely the fact that we outsmarted our enemy is a good sign . " // Philip mumbled something under his breath , then said aloud , " If we are caught , the only reason will be our foolish haste . I ca n't believe you did n't think ahead , Walt-did n't have a plan for where we 'd go with the gold once we got it back . " // As if not hearing him , Walt continued to manhandle the overburdened truck along the narrow mountain road that Sophie was sure was n't designed for a load of this size and weight . // Finally he glanced over , looking past Sophie to Philip . " I thought you 'd at least thank me for saving your life . You 'd be dead , you know , if it were n't for me. " // Sophie could see both their points . She also knew the determination of both men and decided it best not to take sides . // The road climbed a small hill . " Besides ... " Walt angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lagged . " I was n't even sure the plan would work . " His voice was firm . " I 'm only one man , and my connections only go so far . Be thankful I was able to figure out which airfield the shipment would leave from . The fact that everything fell into place surprised even me. " // Getting the truck miles from the airfield as soon as possible had been their first priority . With that accomplished , Sophie hoped Walt had plans to stop , rest , get cleaned up , and maybe find something to eat . // His voice interrupted her thoughts . " I see a creek ahead . You ready for a rest stop ? " // " Yes , fine . Then we need to talk about a plan . " Philip 's fingers tapped against the door handle . // " I would love to stretch my legs . " Sophie pushed all thoughts of Michael from her mind . That was the last thing she needed to worry about . Michael had left her as he escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... to stay with Philip , the man she truly loved . And the most important thing was to set things straight with him . // Walt pulled to the side of the road and parked . The truck still took up most of the dusty dirt road , but it did n't seem to matter . They had n't seen any traffic for the past hour , and Sophie hoped they would n't . Though if they were stopped , Walt could likely talk their way out of danger . His quick thinking and persuasive speech never ceased to amaze her . // The men opened their doors and jumped to the ground , stalking away in separate directions . Sophie sighed , looking out at the countryside . In other circumstances she would appreciate the fact that this was one of the most beautiful places she 'd seen in all of Spain . The narrow road had been cut through a valley where rolling hills met . Trees covered the hills , and sharp mountain peaks rose on either side . // As she climbed out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields next to a burbling creek . Beautiful-a perfect place to set up her easel and pull out her brushes . But she had neither-only the few items left in her satchel . Besides , those things almost seemed to belong to some other girl in another life . She had more challenging things to worry about . // The way Walt and Philip swung their arms and stomped away reminded Sophie of two boys who 'd just been pulled apart from a playground fistfight . They noticed neither the mountain vista nor the wildflowers they tromped beneath their feet . // Philip walked briskly into a field and then stopped , as if realizing he was n't in a hurry after all . Sophie quietly followed him . She had to defend her actions , had to make him understand why it had been so important to return to Michael , why she 'd turned and walked away from Philip at the train station in Madrid three days ago . // She ran a hand through her hair . Had it only been three days ? A lifetime of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * // The ground in the meadow was softer than the hard dirt on the road 's surface , slowing Philip 's agitated pace a bit . His head ached , mostly due to a lack of food and sleep over the last three days when he 'd been held by Michael 's men . Sleeping while tied to a hard wooden chair was n't the easiest thing to accomplish . And he 'd hardly eaten any of the food brought to him . Not that he was n't hungry . The idea of being dependent on his captors-of needing them for food , water ... life ... disgusted him . He hated being helpless , and they reveled in that very thing . // He glanced back over his shoulder and noticed Sophie jumping down from the truck and heading his direction . He should have figured she would follow him . Anger stirred in his chest . Not just at her , but at Michael . Before last week , Michael had been only a name , a foreboding presence . From the moment Philip first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Then the man who 'd hurt her turned up in the flesh . // Philip replayed the moment at the train station once again . Michael at Sophie 's side . Tall , handsome , walking with a commanding presence . He had placed a protective hand on Sophie 's back as they moved through the jostling crowd . Philip instantly hated him-and immediately understood him . Maybe it was because if the roles had been reversed , Philip knew he might have done the same thing . He would have hurt Sophie 's heart in an effort to save her life . And he would have tried to prove himself again to win her back . // It was hard enough seeing Michael with Sophie . It was even worse when the man walked into the small room where Cesar , Michael 's bodyguard , held Philip . Michael tossed an orange back and forth between his hands . He did n't look cruel . In fact , he 'd approached with gentle steps . " Untie him . We need to talk . " // At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a choice . // " I want to know the whole story . I want to know when you met Sophie . Tell me how close you are . " // And for some reason , Philip complied . He told Michael about the accident on the battlefield and how he 'd been assigned as Sophie 's protector as she painted at the field hospital . // Michael listened intently , then nodded . " It seems we love the same woman . And that is no fault of ours . The problem is that I hurt her . And I 'm afraid she 'll never be able to forgive me . " He pulled up a chair and settled across from Philip . " I 'm sure that if you 've been with her , you know what I did . " // Philip jutted out his chin , knowing that if he angered Michael it could mean his death . He did n't care . " You betrayed her . You staged your own death . You abandoned her . And you hoped she 'd leave Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I regret it . I would kill , you , but I 've hurt her enough . " Michael rose and strode away . // Philip hated himself because he understood . He tried to sleep that night , sitting tied to the chair , and the next . Instead , he could n't stop thinking of what he would have done if he 'd been in Michael 's position . // Michael was a thief and a liar , yet it also was possible he loved Sophie-or at least thought he did . Philip tried to imagine if the roles were reversed , and he believed that the only way to save Sophie was to fake his death . She was determined and often let her heart lead over her common sense . She 'd do anything to protect a friend . Anything to protect those she loved . In fact , she put herself into dangerous situations time and time again in hopes of furthering a cause . // Maybe Michael knew what Philip now realized-it took a lot to get Sophie to back down . Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more he thought about it , the more Philip understood his actions . // In the end Philip concluded that he 'd do the same . And he hated himself because of that . He also realized that though he grumbled at Walt because of their predicament , the thing he was maddest at was his own heart . // Because deep down Philip worried whether Sophie might still love Michael as much as Michael obviously cared for her . And Philip wondered where he fit in . The answer to that question mattered far more to him than the fate of the gold . // * * * // Sophie fixed her eyes on the grassy meadow , breathing in the scents of warm grass and sunshine . A small blue butterfly danced from flower to flower ahead of her , as if leading the way . // She watched as Philip scanned the poppy-dotted hillside , but she could tell from his set jaw and sad eyes that he really did n't see it . He glanced at her and sighed , fixing his light blue eyes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more than anything she wanted him to open his arms to her and tell her everything would be okay . Instead they hung limply at his sides . // She had a lot of explaining to do . It was n't just that they 'd been apart for a month , but that she 'd spent that month with the first man she 'd ever loved . A man she still worried about despite all he 'd done to hurt her . // " Philip , I 'd like to try to make you understand . " // " Yes , please do . " // She took a step closer . " I 'm so sorry you got involved in all this . I do n't even want to think about the things that must be going through your mind .... " // He offered her a half smile , but it did n't hide the confusion in his gaze . " Well , I was praying that I 'd get to see you again . I guess my dad was right-you 'd better watch what you pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw from the ropes that had held him prisoner . // She wanted to touch him , to sooth his wounds . Instead she plucked a tall piece of grass and twirled it in her fingers , finding it easier to focus on her own hands than to risk his gaze . " I suppose God is in control . It 's just that at times like this it 's hard to see how . " // " Or why , " Philip added . " Why did I get pulled into this mess ? " // Sophie frowned , hoping by mess he did n't mean her . // " I ca n't go back now , Sophie-fighting with the brigade . They already accused me of being a traitor once . It was because of one man 's kindness that I was given a chance to try again . If I told them I was captured , kidnapped , and taken to Fascist territory by men who wanted to steal some gold coins , no one would believe me . It sounds ridiculous to my own ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on being here . Or planned on not being able to leave .

" She glanced back over her shoulder toward the truck . " More than you imagined , I 'm sure . Yet I think there 's a reason you 're here , Philip . Why our paths crossed near Madrid . I need you . " She hurriedly continued . " Walt needs you too , even though he might not act like it .

Something that was more reassuring to ponder than omens and being captured . // @ @ @ @ @

Against the back wall stood an altar with a statue of a white-browed , red-eyed general mounted on a horse and wielding a sword . Arrayed in front of him were offerings of rice , meat , and wine . // In the center of the room was a table set with chopsticks , bowls , and dishes of snacks . Fang Rong told me to sit between her and Wu Qiang . With no other etiquette , she announced that dinner would begin . A middle-aged woman brought out plates of food , then laid them down one by one on the table . After filling the bowls with rice and soup , she left without a word . // During the whole meal , Fang Rong kept piling food into my bowl . " Eat more , soon you 'll be a very healthy and charming young lady . " // I 'd never before tasted food so delicious . I gulped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beef , washing them down with cup after cup of fragrant tea . // When dinner was finished , I asked , " Aunty Fang- " // " Did n't you forget that I 'm now your mama ? " // Her stare was so fierce that I finally muttered a weak , " Mama . " I swallowed hard . " After dinner , are we going to see the master and the mistress of the mansion ? " // Barely had I finished my question when she burst into laughter . Then she took a sip of her tea and replied meaningfully . " Ha , silly girl ! Do n't you know that we are your new master and mistress ? " // " What do you mean ? " // " That 's what I mean-I am the mistress and my husband is the master of this Peach Blossom Pavilion . " // " What is Peach Blossom Pavilion ? " // " A book chamber . " // I looked around but did n't see any books , not even bookshelves . // Fang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rain pavilion .

" // Wu Qiang looked on with a mysterious smile while his wife burst out in a loud laugh . Then she chided me affectionately . " Why do people always have to have the entrails drawn ? " // She was referring to the Chinese saying that when one paints a portrait , he even includes the intestines-an act redundant and stupid . // Shocked , it took several beats before I could utter , " But did n't you tell us that the master is a merchant of foreign trade ? " // Fang Rong laughed , her huge breasts and bulging belly shivering . " Ha ! Ha ! It 's true . From time to time we do entertain British , French , and American soldiers here . Do n't you know you 've just arrived at the night district of Si Malu ? This is the most high-class shangren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // I felt a queasiness simmering in my stomach . " You mean ... I was sold into- " Fang Rong 's harsh voice pierced my ears . " No , you were not sold , silly girl ! You were given to us as a gift- " // Using his long-nailed pinky to pick some meat from between his teeth while stealing a glance at me , Wu Qiang added , " We did n't even have to pay your mother . " // " That 's why we never forget to make offerings to the Buddha , Guan Yin the Goddess of Mercy , and , " her sausage finger pointing to the sword-wielding , horse-riding general , " the righteous , money-bringing White-Browed God . " Fang Rong winked , then pinched my cheek . " So , little pretty , see how they look after us ! " // Now , as if he were my real father , Wu Qiang looked down at me tenderly , his voice unctuous . " Xiang Xiang , do n't worry . From now on , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wear . You 'll see we 'll take care of you like you 're our own daughter . " // But they were not my mother and father . That night , alone , helpless , and abandoned , I cried a long time before I fell asleep in the small , bare room to which I 'd been led. // My only hope was that my mother would write to me and soon come to visit . // Chapter Two The North Station // In the following days , it surprised me that my anger at being tricked into the prostitution house had gradually waned . I had to admit , with embarrassment , that life here did n't seem to be so bad after all . Fang Rong kept her promise to my mother-I was well clothed and fed . Moreover , I felt relieved to be spared , not only from accompanying clients but also from the menial chores like washing clothes , scrubbing floors , cleaning spittoons , emptying chamber pots . Those jobs were given to maids-girls too plain to ever serve as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine was easy : serving the sisters and their customers while they played mahjong ; refilling the guests ' water pipes and serving them tea and tobacco ; helping the cook in the kitchen ; carrying messages for the sisters ; running errands for Fang Rong .

Especially the mahjong playing-when the game was finished , the customers always tipped me generously by secretly pushing money into my hand . // Moreover , when the game finished and dinner was served in the banquet room , a puppy would always materialize to gobble bits of food thrown down by the guests and sisters . He was so cute that whenever I saw him , I 'd pick him up , squeeze him in my arms , and bury my face into his fluffy yellow fur . Strangely , he was never given a name , but was just called " Puppy . " One time when I 'd asked a sister why did n't the puppy have a name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother .

" he asked , scanning the park for the men . His business with them would have to wait . // " Do n't know yet . Probably autonomy . We ca n't offer help to the Russians until they tell us about the problem . Saying anything now would be tantamount to admitting that we have their embassy bugged . Considering the current political climate , the last thing we need is to cause an international incident , " the Colonel said . " Be careful . This has all the makings of a disaster . " // Pictures of news reports flashed through Parker 's mind : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Russian elite Alpha counterterrorism troops and their Vymple special forces , like their U.S. counterparts , were known for not negotiating with terrorists . Unfortunately , they were also known for getting their enemies at any price , even at the cost of innocent lives . In the theater siege , 115 hostages were killed , in the school standoff , over 300 , many of them children . // Parker popped his earpiece into place , tucked away his phone and broke into a flat run . The men who hunted him would have to wait . The embassy had been taken only minutes ago . There was a small chance that the entire behemoth of a building had n't been secured yet by the rebels . The sooner he got there , the better his chances were for getting in. // " Of the few men we have in the area , you 're the closest , " the Colonel said . " And you know the most about the Tarkmezi situation . " // And Parker suspected that the Colonel had also taken his private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved . Not that the Colonel would ever admit to personal favors. // " I appreciate it , sir , " he told the man anyway . // Rain began to fall again . // " Do try to remember that this is a minimum-impact , covert mission , " the Colonel said in a meaningful tone . // Which meant that he was to make as little contact as possible , remain close to invisible as he searched for Kate and got her out . He was to change nothing , interact with no other aspects of the situation but those strictly required for the extraction. // " And the other hostages ? " // " As soon as their country asks for our help we 'll give it . Our hands are tied until then . " // That idea did n't sit too well with him .

" The Colonel 's tone changed to warning . // " Do n't make me regret that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " // " Just get Kate Hamilton out . " // " Yes , sir . " // That he would . Yeah , he was still mad at Kate for leaving him . Mad as hell , but he was n't going to let any harm come to her .

Well , because I actually like Dunkin ' Donuts way more than Cinnabon . Cinnabon is just a whore , you know , no subtlety . I like almost all the donuts at Dunkin ' Donuts and I really like the coffee though I usually just get regular coffee , milk , no sugar . But today I got coffee , heavy cream . " Anything else ?

" And then before she tallied it up I handed her a fifty and said just keep the change and walked out .

I would like to say I ate tidily and cut off where bite marks were and gave the rest to a homeless person along with a couple of finskis , but I did not .

Generic . // Hot dogs ? Well . I live in Chicago , where we know what hot dogs are and how they should be served .

She ate them in the first-class cabin and all the people used to get pissed off at her . She said they got pissed off because the onions stunk the place up , but I think they got pissed off because they did n't have the foresight to bring a red hot on board themselves . A flight attendant can put all the French words in the world after " beef " and it still tastes like airline food , which tastes like jet fuel smells . // They do n't have red hots in the airport all over the place like they used to . If you come to O'Hare and you have a bit of a layover , get in a cab and tell them Superdawg at Milwaukee and Nagle , it 's only about ten minutes away . Get the regular hot dog , but you might also want to try the Whoopercheesie or Whoopskidawg . There is only one Superdawg and it was started by a guy and his wife , they fell in love in high school and now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working the booth , she sits there in her black nylon windbreaker and you shout your order into the little metal box by where you park . Everybody gets their own speaker and their own menu , which has humorous descriptions of the food . // Portillo 's hot dogs are also good , and their tamales , oh my . You eat them with a plastic spoon , which adds to the flavor , as does the light orange grease stain on the wrapper . But the Portillo 's are not as close to the airport , you might not have time . Although if you said to anyone who knew Chicago , " I missed my flight because I had to go to Portillo 's , " they would say , " Oh , I know , did you get a tamale ? " If you 're debating , which should I go to ? , pick Superdawg , because they are not a chain . Always pick the thing that is not a chain , is one way to try to save the world . // I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where the butter is real and the syrup is real and the waitresses do not in any way judge what you order . I got there at 12:30 and got a table in a good booth because it was across from where Ivy was sitting . Ivy is a regular in her nineties , and she wears a little old lady dress and a sweater and sneakers and a white baseball hat turned frontways . Long gray hair tied back in a skinny ponytail . She orders a little something and then falls asleep before it comes and then after about half an hour her home health aide comes to wake her up and take her back home . // I ordered a bacon cheeseburger , fries , and a chocolate malted , and I loaded up the fries with salt and made a neat pile of catsup . I had whipped cream on the malt and I ate some by itself and then mixed the rest in . When the waitress asked , " Will there be anything else ? " I almost ordered two over easy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potatoes mixed with yolk , but no , that would have been too much wastefulness in one day . // But . Because this was a day purposefully given over to gluttony and greed , I walked over to a bookstore , where I looked at cookbooks . You may think , Right , she looked at dessert books , but that 's where you would be wrong . Because guess what ? Vegetarian . And some Mediterranean and Indian . And okay , then I found this one ? The cake doctor ? Which so made me in the mood for a piece of cake , not a fancy one , just a yellow cake with chocolate frosting . And vanilla ice cream , vanilla enough to be a bit yellow in color . So I went and got that at another caf , but I could only fit in half . // By now I was feeling the shame but also defiance . Like here , I 'm carrying the banner for all of you who cut off a little piece wanting a big one , who spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your desires , who infect those with whom you work and live with your judgments and pronouncements , you on the program who tally points all day long , every day , let 's see , 7 for breakfast , I 'm going to need only 3 or 4 for lunch , what the hell can I have for so little , oh , I know , broth and a salad with very little dressing . And broth is good ! Yes ! So chickeny ! That 's what we tell ourselves , we who can not eat air without gaining , we who eat the asparagus longing for the potatoes au gratin , for the fettuccine Alfredo , for the pecan pie . And if you 're one of those who does n't , stop right here , you are not invited to the rest of this story . // In the afternoon , I rented two movies . Big Night and Tortilla Soup . Which made me starving again even though I was n't . How many people went running out for Italian food after Big Night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because in addition to food as art , you get love of the family variety and more . I returned the movies , stopped at the very famous Petersen 's ice cream parlor for a turtle sundae , extra caramel sauce , and made out my grocery list on a napkin . When I paid at the cashier , I got a bag of Cheetos because there was one of those chip racks and every time I see a chip rack I want some chips . I love Cheetos so much it kind of makes my butt hurt . Every time I fly , I buy a bag of Cheetos ( not the puffy kind , eww ) because you never know , and if I go down , I 'm going to at least have had a bag of Cheetos. // Okay . Dinner . I was going to make dinner . I was going to have steak and mushrooms and a loaded baked potato and Caesar salad because I make better Caesar salad than any restaurant I 've ever been to . And apple crisp and crumb-topped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter that starts with a " P. " After I got it almost ready , I was going to sit on my front porch with a martini with blue-cheese-stuffed olives , and potato chips with Lipton onion soup mix dip , which I love , it has that same thing going for it as Kraft macaroni and cheese . The cheese in the envelope in the box , I should say , the old kind in the box where you yourself must mix the milk and butter // and powdered cheese in . Here is my favorite recipe : Buy two boxes of Kraft macaroni and cheese . Make one box of macaroni but use both cheeses . Telling you this , I just remembered this woman I really liked a lot who died and she loved egg salad more than anything and did n't eat it for years because it was bad for her and then when she was on her deathbed and could have anything she wanted , she was given an egg salad sandwich and she could n't eat it // anymore . // So dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mushrooms sauted in butter lying seductively over the steak .

I knew after the day was over , I 'd have to go back to the plan , go back and confess at my meeting . Which is okay , it 's fine , you can say anything at a meeting . Once someone said she had cheesecake left in her refrigerator from a family dinner and everyone was saying , " Oh , my God , get rid of it , give it away . " Someone else said , " Just throw it away . " And this other woman said , " Well , I 'm sort of embarrassed to admit this but I have actually taken food out of my garbage and now I 've learned that I have to pour water on it before I throw it away . " // I myself put coffee grounds over food I throw away , that 'll do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up practically the whole time telling how she fell off the wagon . And all of us at the edges of our seats , eating it all with her in our imaginations . And also feeling a little bit smug that we did n't fall off the wagon . This time . I ate the dinner , the whole thing , just like I said . And then I took a wooden mallet and I beat the shit out of my scale . I wanted springs to pop out like they might in a cartoon , but all that happened was it did n't work anymore // and it had a few dents . Still . // The next day I went to a Weight Watchers meeting , and the blind lady was there again . " How are you doing ? " I said to her and she said , " Okay . How about you ? " " Okay , " I said .

She said she was telling a new member the rules and she guessed she talked too fast . Because she told the woman be sure to drink six to eight glasses of water a day . And the woman came back the next week saying , " I did everything you said , but I just ca n't drink sixty-eight glasses of water a day .

@@4022361 Let 's call them TOLA and EAMPH -- acronyms for Television-Obsessed Literary Agent and Editor At Major Publishing House . They 're not bad people ; really , they 're both lovely , intelligent women . They 're just coping with the pressures of the industry . The phrase comes with a knowing glance , a shrug , even over the phone . // I do n't live in New York , so the industry is n't a big part of my daily life , and it rarely enters my consciousness , especially when I 'm writing . I live in Mill Valley , California , in a cramped house with no view that 's probably worth more than the GNP of a small Caribbean nation . I live with my husband , Brent , our three-year-old daughter , Samantha , and Brent 's kids ( of whom he has full custody , because -- amazingly -- his ex-wife is even more useless than he is ) . The kids are blond , twins , a boy and a girl . Let 's call them Buffy and Jody. // From what I can tell , the book business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it and the people are n't beautiful . I consider myself one of the lucky ones . I had my first novel published by a major press two years ago as part of a six-figure , two-book deal . The lowest six figures available , mind you , minus , of course , 15 percent to TOLA 'S agency , fifteen grand to the outside publicist , traveling expenses for the book tour I put myself on , book-tour wardrobe , makeup , okay , okay , I admit it , a couple of shots of book-tour Botox . Actually , if I tally up the expenses , subtract them from the advance , divide that by the amount of time I put into writing the first book , it works out to like three dollars and fourteen cents an hour -- p . My hourly wage has been p . For a writer , that 's a success story , and I realize Dave Eggers made similar calculations and came out reeking of gratitude , but he had youth and male gender on his side -- needed neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got three kids living in my house , orthodontia looming . On the bright side , TOLA 'S been talking to a producer about a dramatic rights option . Some person is actually thinking about making a television series out of my book , a collection of literary stories that my publisher released as a novel . I wrote about a community of women on the board of a Beverly Hills charity , and this producer thinks it could work as one of those primetime dramas . Please do n't think I wrote about Beverly Hills because I 'm drawn to the place . I wrote about it because I grew up there . I fled the minute I could , but writers often need to purge the story of their hometown in their first book . The book did okay , got some nice reviews , and though it did n't earn out its advance , I was grateful to be published at all . TOLA and EAMPH were reasonably satisfied . The problem is the second book . Well , that and my family . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I 'm bitching too much -- here I am pursuing my creative dream , while my hardworking husband is out all day running a hedge fund or developing a luxury subdivision in Healdsburg . Brent does not work , says he 's permanently injured from his last job as an IT specialist , the job he lost just about as soon as we married , though his injury does n't seem to affect his windsurfing when we go up to Lake Tahoe or his skiing in the winter . Mostly he lies around the house all day , watching obscure sports on ESPN2 , dabbling with a disability claim . He says , " Disability would be passive income , you know ? Like my version of a dramatic rights deal . " // " Passive , sure , " I tell him . " But where 's the income ? " So far it 's all been bills for the legal counsel . // " You give me a lot of shit , but I 've got this ache in my neck and shoulders about 60 to 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your burden of guilt ! " He walks out of the room before I can tell him about the pain in my ass 100 percent of the time . I would n't mind so much the fact that I 'm hemorrhaging money -- it 's having Brent underfoot all day that drives me nuts . Even Samantha goes to preschool , but my husband is like The Thing In The Basement , and if he 's got any legitimate illness , it 's male depression , non-covert . Anyway , the person who supports us is Mel , my stepfather , who maxed out the gift tax applicable exclusion when I bought my house and who sends both Brent and me checks for twenty-four thousand dollars each year and pays private-school tuition for Buffy , Jody , and Samantha . Mel keeps us afloat , though the arrangement also keeps me feeling ashamed , illegitimate . Face it , my father was sick for a long time , so I do n't condemn my mother for marrying Mel about a split second after they pulled out the life support tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was Beverly Hills . No one blinked . And I doubt the body was cold before Mel filed papers to adopt me and he and my morn starting referring to my dad as my birth father . // " Call me " Daddy ! " Mel barked at their wedding reception at Hillcrest Country Club . He pulled me into his lap for a photo . " A little girl like you still needs a daddy . " // I downed another shot of tequila . " Yes , Daddy . " I was sixteen , a junior at Beverly High , not sure I needed parents at all . // But over the years , Mel and I became friends . He supports my writing habit and my bad taste in men . I confide in him . When I visit L.A. , we always make time to have lunch at Hillcrest , alone . This visit , we are eating Cobb salads out on the patio , and the big lawn down to the tennis courts becomes blurry with my tears . I say , " Brent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey , we all know that , " Mel says . " But that 's life . " He takes my hand . " Honey , marriage is n't easy . You have a lot of good things though -- the kids , your writing . Look , some people do choose to split up . Some hash out all the problems . Still others . well , they find ways to stay together even if it is n't ideal . One person gets absorbed with work or friends . Another has an affair . With her father , for instance . " Mel squeezes my arm , and I snort apiece of crumbled Gorgonzola . " There 's always been something special between us , huh , Cookie ? " His blue eyes sparkle . " So how 's the new book coming ? " // I 'm glad Burt Knoebel and Tommy Frankenthal show up at our table to say hi before I can answer . // Guilt makes the world go around , at least in the overdeveloped world , and that 's the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of flinching reflex that happens when you grow up in Beverly Hills . I mean , I was so happy when I got into UC Santa Cruz for college , and there was no question of my staying Up North in the Other California when I graduated , but I 'm always hitting that same horrible wall when people ask me where I 'm from . Over the years , I 've learned to look them in the eye and calmly say , " Los Angeles , " then switch subjects . Often , they press further , ask , " Where in L.A. ? " Sometimes " West L.A. " gets me by . Not usually . Sometimes , I just come out with it , mumbled slightly , my hand passing over my face like I 'm brushing away a stray hair , " Bvrly Hlls , " slurred , I need to buy a vowel . Then I wait for the reaction . If the other person says , " Wow ! " I think , Oh God , what an asshole . If they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , all clipped and terse , I know I 'm being judged , boho reverse snobbery is in play , and I do n't stand a chance . When I first met Brent at a party for the Human Rights Film Festival in Berkeley , he smiled and said , " You do n't seem like a Beverly Hills kind of person . Do you love living here ? " I nodded , so grateful I was afraid I would weep . I might as well have just blurted out in that moment , " I love you ! " // That was more than five years ago , and during the daytime , with the twins and Samantha and a new book due in less than six months , I do n't have a lot of time to think about how I loved my husband more the moment I met him than in any moment since . I do get strung out at night , when I have insomnia but I 'm too tired to write . I liked Brent 's passivity at first , mistook it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important than his work , though I also liked it that he was working back then . When I 'm up at night , I think about how I probably should leave him , but maybe the dead weight of the four other sleeping bodies under my roof makes me feel too trapped to take action . Maybe it 's my perfectionism , my attachment to being part of an intact family , my preference for the happy ending . Certainly , I ca n't do anything drastic until the manuscript is finished . Instead , I stay up reading Orhan Pamuk , Ian McEwan , Amy Tan . I try Roddy Doyle , but find myself skipping pages . I reread all of Jane Austen 's novels , in a beautiful , musty-smelling 1898 edition Mel gave me for my last birthday -- all except for Mansfield Park , because " poor Fanny " gets on my nerves and I want to abuse her as much as her own evil family did . I read The Ambassadors and The Wings of the Dove . // The only thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't write ; we get together to drink and bitch about being writers . These are people who would never fit into my domestic life , nor I into theirs , but we understand that we convene as writers only , and we leave our spouses at home and do n't even pretend to remember the names of one another 's children . We sit in a bar in Sausalito overlooking the bay and drink Australian Shiraz . We swap the latest war stories . Anthony , a slim , gay man with some East Indian blood , some Hispanic , a dark olive complexion and full , curling lips , has the worst one tonight . Anthony got his book published this year , no big advance but good reviews , and it was even chosen as a Book Sense Pick . But he 's still working on his MFA through the nonresident program at Owen Olson College in Prescott , Arizona . Reinaldo Gz , the Owen Olson program director and , in Anthony 's words , " an envious fuck , who 's only got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his years of literary insider status , " wo n't accept Anthony 's book for his master 's thesis because it got published . " Is n't that what I 'm supposed to be doing ? " Anthony says , nearly sputtering . " Writing publishable fiction ? // " Well , not that publishable , according to Gz . ' You see , Anthony , ' " Anthony imitates him , stroking an invisible beard , " ' the fact that this text is already in print hardly leaves it open to pedagogical inquiry . ' He 's a loser , " Anthony rages , " who releases his own inner self-hatred upon Owen Olson students . And because he 's a loser , I have to come up with a minimum eighty pages of some new book by May . " // Everyone in the group is sorry . Anthony so does n't deserve this . Someone asks , " Do you have anything sitting aside in a drawer ? " // Anthony raises his graceful arms to the sky . " A collection of suicide notes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . I received an advance to be tortured . Anthony is paying tuition , a lot of it . // In New York , I meet TOLA and EAMPH in a minimalist restaurant with black plates and napkins that match TOLA 'S black sweater and knit skirt and her narrow , black plastic eyeglasses . She is exceptionally neat and moves briskly , though always with intention . She made a lot of money this year co-authoring a book about ridding oneself of clutter. // EAMPH is a whole different thing from TOLA . She 's a blond , fluffy , languid sort of person who commutes to her job from Far Hills , New Jersey . I imagine a slogan embossed in brass-colored letters on her vintage , saddle-leather Filofax : I 'D RATHER BE RIDING MY HORSE . She has four children , all either in prep school or a fine Northeastern college ; her work for the press is a day job . Not that she is n't highly literate , does n't love to read . I just suppose she likes to read the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- an activity entirely divorced from her work for the publishing house . I know she was drawn to my book for its old-fashioned comedy-of-manners style and managed to get it by her publisher because it was set in Beverly Hills . The press had just made a fortune on a book called The Beverly Hills Botox Club , a trashy , gossipy piece of shit written by a twenty-three-year-old who worked as a personal assistant to a big producer 's wife , and no , I am not a hypocrite -- it 's one thing to take a couple of shots for public appearances , another to write a whole book about the stuff . Anyway , EAMPH thought maybe my book would ride the wake of the Botox Club 's publicity . Unfortunately for the press , though personally I have very mixed feelings here , my book was mostly read on its own terms and praised for what was genuinely good about it -- non-newsworthy things like craft and voice -- so it did n't hit any bestseller lists . At least EAMPH never seems bothered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I find it a source of constant self-torment -- she has a kind of dreamy , Oh well , next time , attitude and surely never thinks about anything related to her office when she 's home in Far Hills . The three of us sit in the well-designed restaurant , eating thinly pounded veal cutlets , spring-like with chopped arugula and tomatoes on top . We talk about the trip EAMPH and her husband are planning this summer to cruise the Norwegian fjords . In the last minutes of our meeting , EAMPH mentions my next novel . She and TOLA speak of it as if it 's already written , really exists , with no doubt at all about my ability actually to produce something that will be acceptable to her publisher . I go along with the fantasy ; no point in getting EAMPH concerned I might not make deadline . As if she 'd lose sleep anyway . // After lunch , TOLA and I go around the corner to Starbucks . No word yet on a dramatic rights deal , though TOLA says she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossy black hair and leans her chin on the heel of her hand . " So tell me more about the new property . " In TOLA-speak , property means book . // I try . I really try . I believe I 'm writing something beautiful , something completely different from the first book , set on a remote island in the South Pacific . " I feel like I 'm following in the tradition of Somerset Maugham , his colonial stories and faraway books like The Painted Veil or The Moon and Sixpence . Especially The Moon and Sixpence , because it 's the story of an artist who hates domesticity -- you know , I 've always interpreted Maugham 's misogyny as a hatred of domesticity rather than women -- but my book is contemporary , too , since the protagonist is a woman , and aside from answering her artistic calling , she 's following her true sexual impulses and desires , not those imposed upon her by society . " // TOLA 'S heard enough ; her eyes look opaque . She carefully stirs her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slips her glasses back on . " I think you could get away with an island setting if you do something like Survivor meets Sex in the City . " // " Sex in the City ! I 've never even seen it . " // " It 's a good show . You should watch it . " // Though I , too , am a female artist who hates domesticity , I 'm as buried alive as it gets , so one evening after Samantha has her bath and book and about seven different stalling complaints about an itchy arm and twisted sheets , and after Buffy and Jody have had it explained to them that two times two does not equal five , no matter what they both , in their twin-like psychic weirdness , think Miss Tomiko taught them today , I join Brent in the guestroom/den/finished basement space downstairs , where he is lying on the pulled-out sofa bed watching an episode of Walker , Texas Ranger on the top half of the screen while the listings of what 's playing on the 397 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the City , starting in ten minutes . I will watch TV as prescribed by TOLA -- save my marriage and career at the same time . I get through about fifteen minutes of a rodent-faced redhead masturbating under the covers while the man with whom she 's having phone sex keeps putting her on hold . It 's unbearable . I go back upstairs to read Graham Greene 's The Comedians. // Before my book contract , I had the pleasure of a slow , step-by-step path into a writing career . Early on , I was lucky enough to place a few short stories in small magazines . My mother happened to be up in Mill Valley visiting Brent and me -- well , me ; Brent was there -- the day I opened my mail and whooped in excitement at an acceptance letter from a well-known , more prestigious literary journal . // My mother asked , " What story is that , darling ? " // Oops . It was that one written in the third person , so clearly about myself , the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of person who dreams about snakes and water holes . If she needs to dream about giving her stepfather a blow job , she goes right ahead and dreams it . " Let 's just make it a surprise , " I told my mother : // Three months later , when the story was published , my mother called to congratulate me. // I asked , " What did Mel say ? " // " Oh , well . For once , he did n't say much . I suppose he was flattered . " My mother giggled . " I suppose one could say he was blown away by it . " // My minor literary successes gradually increased . Writing was a pleasure , an indulgence ; it garnered some small material rewards , like free copies and three-figure checks , but more important , it made me feel good about myself . People were actually paying me to hear what I had to say . I was used to paying to talk to someone , at least one hundred and fifty dollars an hour . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , by a few others . Surely , though , it was n't a job . Then , I got successful : two-book contract , book tour , reviews , interviews , the deadline on the next book . Boom , boom , boom , boom , boom . On top of Samantha . // It 's not like I 've written nothing toward the second novel . Slowly , slowly , I 've scraped about two hundred pages from my consciousness , most of them set on the remote island in the South Pacific I had described to TOLA . I think there 's even a compelling storyline . But now it 's August , and my deadline is looming . I feel an overwhelming need to show my work to EAMPH . This business of being on contract for two years with no idea of how I 'm performing in my publisher 's estimation is getting to me. // " Okay , " TOLA says , when she finally calls me back . I do n't know why , but she seems able to speak only at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks up Samantha from preschool , then releases her like a self-guiding missile into our house . TOLA continues , " Send the manuscript to me , then I 'll get it to EAMPH . It 's important to submit through the official agency channels . " // " Uh-huh . " I try to remember what I 'm agreeing to , what we were even talking about . It 's hard to concentrate with Samantha slamming her dense toddler body against my locked bedroom door screaming , " Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy ! " // I hang up with TOLA . " Okay , Sweetheart , I 'm coming . It 's okay . Mommy 's here . " Why ca n't my stupid husband play with her for ten fucking minutes ? // EAMPH has had the manuscript six weeks before she replies . I already know it 's trouble -- she 's sent the initial e-mail to TOLA about wanting to take time with her response and put it in writing . So I 'm not shocked when her e-mail finally comes , with the diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've created wonderful , believable characters and artful descriptions of the island setting . Then there 's the but clause : but I think readers might find it hard to identify with a protagonist who has bisexual desires and an affair with her friend 's husband . Also , the leading man is a sort of distasteful character -- deceitful , hard to warm up to . // Now I am shocked . Shocked ! EAMPH , presumably , is looking for commercial women 's fiction . And it 's not okay to have a protagonist who sleeps with her friend 's husband . Does n't she watch television ? Well , I hope not -- I do n't either . But is n't that all over television , on the soap operas , Desperate Housewives ? I 've never seen Desperate Housewives , who knows what they 're up to , but it 's naughty , adulterous , treacherous , no ? What about Paris Hilton ? Britney Spears ? // What about that E. L. Doctorow book , where the guy burns the girl 's buttocks with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Irving wrote ? What about Lolita ? I happen to be in the middle of Lolita right now , and I hate to admit this , but I 'm reading Lolita for the first time . I 'm not even reading it because I have an intellectual yearning to explore Nabokov beyond the passing glance I gave to Pale Fire in a contemporary lit class at Santa Cruz twenty years ago . I 'm actually reading Lolita because I bought a copy of the bestseller , Reading Lolita in Teheran , and , I mean , I should have read Lolita first , right ? Yes , this is embarrassing , I 'm so ill-read , but I 'm trying , trying to catch up , so I 'm reading Lolita , reading Lolita under book contract , and my editor thinks my own adulterous protagonist is smutty and disgusting , and her lover is smutty and disgusting , and , hell , I probably am too . // Anyway , I now have the answer I 've been dreading and another shocking piece of information I forgot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may be smutty and disgusting , but they are not throwing me out . I suggest you propose new characters in a new situation for the next novel . For the sake of your career , your second book needs to do very well , both with reviewers and in terms of sales . Let 's talk next week and bat about some other ideas . // So . So , I 'm just supposed to throw away these two hundred pages I 've slaved over , trying to make deadline , and come up with another book I can " bat about " next week ! Is she kidding ? No ! She 's not kidding ! She 's serious . I need to come up with an idea for a commercial and critical hit book by next week . Or a few ideas preferably -- more to bat ! Sure . A few books by next week . Of course . No problem . I always come up with hit books over the average weekend -- always ! // And the sick thing is , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rack my brains all weekend , even as I 'm standing at the side of the field at Jody and Buffy 's Saturday morning soccer game , trying to keep Samantha from tearing off the leg of my jeans . I think and think , as I 'm pretending to watch CNN with Brent that night -- the British hostages in Iran -- who can worry about a standoff with Iran , I need a critically and commercially successful second novel . I know what EAMPH wants . The first book was about Beverly Hills , so obviously -- obviously ! -- the second one should take on Hollywood : the film industry or rock ' n ' roll . The glamour element , that 's what she wants , that 's what the press can sell , and that 's just exactly what I fled from when I left Southern California forever the day after I graduated high school . It 's exactly what I can not write , sorry , no knowledge whatsoever of any glamorous world after 1982 -- they 've met me -- ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd settle for a book that is n't a novel .

I think as I 'm shaking dust and dried grass off Buffy and Jody 's long , stinky soccer socks , dropping their still-damp team uniforms into the cold wash . I could write a book about not living out one 's crazy stories in real life but getting them down on paper instead -- Put Your Drama On The Page ! That sounds like a seller , I 'm sure EAMPH would take it , though what can I say in it beyond the premise of the title ? Maybe there 's not enough material here for a hit book .

On top of which , being focus of unambiguous love radiating from entire population of recently adopted-into Homo post hominem community , all of whom ( tiresome but true ) owe Yours Truly their lives , does enhance outlook generally . Normally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real fun-classes : academics ( usually one-on-one instruction in college-level math , physics , chem , geology , agronomy , psychology normal and ab- , etc. ) ; as well as practical mechanics , electronics ; regular proficiency maintenance and/or additional type-rating flight training sessions ; plus daily advanced karate instruction ( currently honing sixth-degree Black Belt skills ; seventh still well beyond horizon ) coupled with-probably most entertaining of all-personal tutoring in selected elements from Mossad field agents ' mayhem manual . Apart from routine expectations , however , this morning not remotely normal . Awoke to ominous realization that that vague , recurrent disquiet , which , despite fiercely protective , almost crchelike environment in which have been enveloped since medical discharge ( following treatment for side effects stemming from most recent round trip across River Styx ) was back in force . Last time awoke to such depths of foreboding was morning of Daddy 's departure for Washington-the day before Khraniteli turned capital , surrounding suburbs , into fine , black , glowing-in-dark ashes drifting in breeze , ending World As We Knew It , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from moment eyes opened today , chain of events resembled ballistic curve : foreordained progression , leading directly from bed to Teacher 's announcement to Yours Truly 's reluctant but immutable decision-thence to current AWOL status . Well , a girl 's got ta do what a girl 's ... Etc . As turned out , however , anarchic decision , subsequent obviously proscribed actions , took healthy bite out of unease dogging heels since morning 's first awareness . Perhaps qualms more a function of psychic feedback spawned by own upcoming brash actions echoing back down timeline rather than intangible warning of yet another impending doomy threat . In any event , Posterity , been some time since our last travelogue , has n't it . Truthfully , though , had n't expected-certainly never intended-ever again to do another travel , much less logue . And not without justification : Even briefest reflection upon Yours Truly 's conspicuously absent vital signs , to say nothing of generally bent , broken , and/or toasted medical condition by conclusion of events chronicled in most recent volumes of The Journals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adventurer , 1 should motivate thickest observer toward sober deliberation regarding wisdom of such endeavors . Take , for instance , side effects of saving Adam from wrecked , flaming automobile : Psilly pseudo Walter Mitty had achieved spectacular crash while indulging race-driver fantasies on deserted downtown Baltimore city streets . Ultimately , hysterical strength overuse required to extricate comatose boy from four-wheeled pyre , carry him at a dead run draped over shoulder to van , remain conscious long enough thereafter to suture young idiot 's sliced femoral artery , resulted in your Humble Historiographer 's heart joining ranks of flatlined . Granted , own willful disregard of onrushing metabolic burnout symptoms spotlight descriptive limitations of reckless . Still , extra effort seemed warranted at the time : Had reason to fear lad might be sole other surviving human being on Planet Earth . Happily , was n't . Quite . However , barely recovered from physiological deficits incurred during that girlish prank before found self in spacesuit , flambing like lobster while being battered to pulp by unyielding interior structural members of decidedly non-passenger-rated , End of Days-bomb-carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrobatics portion of incandescent atmospheric reentry . This event , too , capped by cessation of Plucky Girl Adventurer 's cardiac functions . Clearly , campaigns offering such potential direness not to be undertaken lightly . Odds too high that Closing Credits may have to be superimposed over marker under which bones have taken up residence at Our Lady of Perpetual Dandelions Memorial Landfill-or , more likely , just strewn willy-nilly across terrain , wherever carrion-disposal fauna lose interest . In any event , none of those experiences ranks high amongst memories back upon which your Humble Historiographer looks most fondly-or has any difficulty not raising hand , joyously caroling " Again ... ! " But damn , Posterity ! Really-what was Teacher thinking ... ? I mean , right after breakfast , even before leaving chow hall , practically skipped up , beaming ear-to-ear , gave me big , happy hug , and , straight out of blue , announced , " Candy , the Urals scouting expedition got in last night ... " Okay , I knew that . Actually , everybody knew that : Hominem community , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in no danger of challenging New York , Moscow , Beijing for title of World 's Majorest Metropolis ( even after Hsapiens ' effectively total extinction ) . As spin-off benefit of settlement 's cozy dimensions , airstrip located practically next-door-where seismic-level thrust-reverser sound effects from pair of C-17 Globemaster IIIs ( aviation 's answer to Monster Trucks ) braking to stop just after sundown not that readily overlooked . So standing alone , beloved pedagogue 's breathless proclamation hardly qualified as news , let alone bombshell . Still , enthusiasm level suggested other shoe already in pattern , probably on final , if not actually preparing for touchdown ... And indeed was . Radiating what , for him , equated to gleeful intensity of Olde Tyme TV game-show host introducing prize lineup , Teacher continued , " And while they were there , they acquired information suggesting that your father is probably still alive , as well as where the Khraniteli may be holding him . " All right , Posterity ; that part exceeded " bombshell " threshold ! In feet , as joyous revelation 's universere-shuffling internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big sister 's shoulder by swinging head around to front , turning cranium upside down , peering one-eyed up my nose . Fortunately , however , this time retarded adopted twin brother limited comment to wolf whistle 's long , low , closing diminuendo-as opposed to customary practice of sharing sapient sibling 's innermost cerebral contents with world at window-rattling volume . Shushed silly symbiont by reaching up , gently stroking tiny soft feathers on head , cheeks , upper neck area just under huge clamshell beak . And focused ki flow into effort required to maintain calm thoughts , serene , interested expression as world rocked , spun around me-and abruptly , cause of , solution to , morning 's amorphous disquiet snapped into sharpest focus . ... Even if Terry had n't felt elder sister turn to stone , Posterity , I knew feather-headed twin unfooled . Birdbrain alone , out of planet 's entire remaining population ( okay , arguably Lisa , too ) , equipped fully to appreciate shock Teacher 's announcement had delivered . No one doubts anymore : Foster twins share one-way telepathic rapport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Terry can read my mind-and from quite a distance : last count , 32,500 miles ; geosynchronous orbit height plus Earth 's full diameter . All of which demonstrated conclusively a few months ago when Intrepid Girl Astronaut found self trapped in orbit aboard crippled space shuttle ( while saving all that remained of Humanity , she tossed in casually ) . On that occasion , thoughts apparently passed through planet 's substance as if so much vacuum . In any event , notwithstanding smarty-mouth id 's internal sarcasm , Teacher now had Plucky Girl Savior of Our People 's undivided attention . But then , with typical clueless preoccupation borne of Overlapping Deep Thoughts , complicated by Weight of Responsibilities , dear old thing continued blithely , " And at this point , it looks as if it wo n't take much more than six months to put together another expedition back into the area to check into it .... " Really now , Posterity . As long as Teacher 's known me ( what ? -almost whole life ? ) , could not have expected favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then just sit around , waiting patiently while Daddy languishes in Khraniteli dungeon , no doubt being tortured , probably scheduled for execution-for another six solid months ... ? Received news with enthusiasm of hungry trout rising to fat mayfly-and reached decision even before Teacher completed recital . But . While Yours Truly may not be sharpest bulb in quiver ( or is that brightest pencil in drawer ? ) , have managed , during short , busy lifetime , to identify certain fundamentally human behavioral principles every bit as applicable to H. post hominems as H. sapiens ; key among which : Objecting , arguing-even begging-adults to reverse what they regard as well-thought-out decisions generally has single practical effect : Spills beans concerning own intentions ; opens door for inconvenient advice-potentially , even , orders : " Do n't do that . " Clearly , last thing Plucky Girl Adventurer needed at this point was to trigger suspicions . What was called for , however , was factual , mission-specific information : " intel , " if you will . So smiled beatifically , hugged , thanked Teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stalker mode , tracked down Danya Feinberg , AAs ' number two special-operations **57;504;TOOLONG . Prior to Mankind 's End , Danya had been top Mossad field operative ; specialty , " proactive threat elimination " euphemism for assassination . All too appropriately , since given name translates to Judgment of God . ( Which has always bothered me : How could parents have known ? I mean , really , so soon after birth , to look down at freshly hatched , sweet-faced baby girl happily blowing bubbles against mother 's breast , announce to world , with perfectly straight face , " This child will grow up to become the instrument of the Judgment of God ... " ) Moot question , of course . Did . And now , with other AAs , Danya works for Teacher . Incidentally , number two ranking amongst AA spooks mostly result of coin toss . Wallace Griffin ( describes himself as out-of-work Navy Seal ) unabashedly admits his field skills fell short of hers , but even Danni agrees Wallace 's gift for strategy unmatched among hominem ranks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says world missed unmatched opportunity to experience Genghis Khan redux when Wallace opted not to focus talents on Dark Side . ) In any event , according to Teacher , even in pseudomilitary structure , someone has to be in charge . As suspected , caught up with Danya at base showers . Following return from three-week , living-off-land , intel-gathering recon in Urals , existing mostly as solo marauder/gleaner , Momma Spook spending substantial portion of first morning home reveling in leisurely , luxurious , catch-up soak under virtually inexhaustible , solar-heated , steaming hot water . Parked Terry on adjacent showerhead feeder gooseneck , turned on water . Manic twin promptly launched into joyous series of upside-down , furiously flapping , bathing gymnastics ; continuing objective : Spread as much water as widely as possible , without actually coming into contact with any , except very tip of bill . Shucked off own clothing , stepped under shower , then paused to regard Danni with usual carefully concealed resentment ... Visualize stereotypical barbarian warrior princess from vintage , heroic , Boris Vallejo cover painting for epic Thud &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Supermodel 's face , with flawless brow , cheekbones , chin ; perfect , gleaming white teeth . Eyes so blue , they seem to catch , amplify , reflect light across darkened rooms . Technically , only five-five but tall nonetheless , with almost rangy frame boasting deceptively sleek , well-developed musculature , marathoner 's utterly dimple/jiggle-free , hard little glutei maximi , all wrapped in golden , line-free suntan . Presentation capped by secondary curves whose firmly assertive proportions sneer at Newton 's second law .... Total effect ( according to Adam ) " reduces men to idiots " ; and , from own experience , inspires less well-assembled females to engage in thoughtful deliberation regarding pros , cons of pacts with devil . ( Eternal damnation .. . hey , how bad could it be ... ? ) Eighth Degree Black Belt , unmitigated death in bare feet , since my arrival Danya has taken me under wing ; have become , in fact , her favorite pseudo-Mossad apprentice . And few aspects of life these days deliver more sheer fun than training under Danni 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonstandard weapons ; plus special-operations skills ( infiltration , silently taking out sentries , sniping ) ; undercover work ; interrogation ; etc . Danni even managed to introduce element of humor into hysterical strength tap , concerning whose use Yours Truly has become almost phobic ( not unreasonably , given death 's recurring prominence in medical history ) : Persuaded me to replace original cumbersome , four-word , self-hypnotic prompt phrase ( " chocolate , cabbage , caterpillar , puck " ) with quicker , more classically appropriate , single trigger word : " Sha-zam ... ! " Plus , along with other two unofficial sisters , Kim and Gayle , Danni really fun snicker-buddy at **30;563;TOOLONG get-togethers . ( Okay , okay-obviously , such gatherings chiefly for my benefit . No , do n't really believe Kim , Gayle , or Danni older women , all-mid 20s , at least regard boys as giggleworthy subjects per se . Not even Adam who really is . Still ... ) Withal , no matter how hard I try on occasion , Danni difficult person to dislike . Except when forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; months short of 12th birthday ; still whole inches shy of five feet tall ; hardly more than pro forma female thus far- Never mind ; among pointless exercises in frustration , self-flagellation over unavoidable surely ranks near list 's apex .... No point beating around bush with Danya , Posterity ; respected her too much even to make attempt . Plus ( more than peripheralest of considerations ) , fact that , while superspook claims not to be actual mindreader , is way too smart for slow-dancing subterfuges ; would spot oblique approach in heartbeat . And by this point , not arousing grownup suspicions regarding immediate plans for information 's application had taken on vital importance . So got right to it ; wide-eyed , unaffectedly enthusiastic as any other kid who 'd just learned long-dead father possibly not : " Danni , " I demanded , " Teacher says you guys heard something about Daddy during your recon . Where is he ? Who 's got him ? " Mentor regarded me thoughtfully before replying . Does that a lot . Depending upon circumstances , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to stare down hungry snake . " We do n't know that anyone 's actually got him got him , " Danya began eventually ; " at least at this point . While scouting Serdtsevina Rasovyi , the base outside their big shelter under the Urals , just north of the Russian/Kazakhstani border , I questioned a Khranitel who admitted to being part of the Bratstvo group who snatched Dr. Foster out of Washington just before they vaporized it . " Honest , Posterity , really tried to restrain self , but could n't have held tongue at gunpoint : " So he is alive ! " " He was alive then , " Danya corrected sympathically . " He did n't die when Washington did ; we know that . He- " " Did your contact tell you where he is ? " I pressed . Danni hesitated again ; then : " You have to understand , " she temporized , " this was not a contact per se ; not a friendly conversation with a helpful local . I made this man disappear from the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of course a Khranitel ; by definition , a zealot . He did not wish to tell me anything . I had to ... " paused again , obviously trying to choose words with care , " ... encourage him ... " Paused again , eyed me with detectible concern , then finished in rush , " -quite a lot . " Yet another pause . " And while I did want to hear more about Dr. Foster , my mission was to learn what I could about the Khraniteli 's current military situation : strategy , assets , technology levels , agent deployment ... " A final pause . " His mention of Dr. Foster occurred early in the questioning . About all this man told me was that they had taken your father back to Serdtsevina Rasovyi . In addition to housing their headquarters , that 's where one of their larger , better-equipped laboratories is located . " The Khraniteli wanted to pick his brains . Apparently they 've come up with the notion of using gene-engineering to try to develop a bug we hominems are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the world 's leading expert in combating biological warfare before the holocaust , today he 's the only real expert in existence on how one goes about developing such microbes . " By the time I was certain I 'd gotten everything from this fellow I could pertinent to my mission objectives , it was ... he was ... " Danni trailed off tastefully , eyes averted . Nodded silently to convey understanding , hint of sympathy for unpleasant necessities . But behind otherwise carefully nonreacting expression , had difficulty not grinding teeth : Whenever so-called grownup topics ( e.g. , killing , torture , generic mayhem of any description ) intrude upon discussions , adults-even Danni , despite ongoing special-ops training 's patently lethal focus ! -tend to walk on eggs in my presence ; act as if somehow , despite short , blood-soaked history , am still vulnerable innocent , needing to be protected from realities of post-apocalypse life , death . Sweet little self-deceptions like this no doubt helpful to adults ' emotional well-being-but damned nuisancy for people who have things to do , places to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Delays departure . So bit lip ; maintained grateful , cheery smile ; thanked her effusively . Finished shower ; departed at apparent leisure . -And immediately set out to track down Wallace Griffin . Happily , found officially number one spook not in shower . ( " Happily " : Though for majority of younger hominems , skinny-dipping down at lovely little creek-fed pond between housing and airfield pretty much routine , Wallace not one of Teacher 's actual AAs ; not even of their generation ; instead , one of those anomalous older H. post hominems who had emerged previously , differences unnoticed at the time by World at Large . Sweetly old-fashioned in so many ways ; and , when too much skin involved , age/gender distinctions tend to distract , possibly even distress him . ) Found head spook in office , door open , informally closeted with Peter Bell , de fecto number two hominem after Teacher . Peter also ( though do n't think he knows this ) subject of dearest leader 's first delicate matchmaking suggestion for me . This , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius ; world-class pianist ; universe-class chef ; amateur EMT ( who has restarted my heart twice thus far ) ; frighteningly intelligent ; side-splittingly funny ; ruggedly handsome ( for someone who does n't shave yet-still sticking to age-18 story but , sh-h-h , early on I found birth certificate ; boy really only 13 ) ; and actually ( when not crashing cars ) , world-class driver ; pilot , too ... Sorry , Posterity ; yes , have been told I tend to digress . Like most fundamentally innocent , older hominem males , where Yours Truly is concerned , Wallace ca n't help himself : Unambiguously dotes upon very ground I tread . Usually I go out of my way not to , but this was special occasion : Took shameless advantage of slack grownups all cut me ( cute little Selfless Savior of Our People , etc. ) to interrupt intelmeister , pump dry : Gleaned everything he 'd heard , deduced , divined about Daddy 's purported/potential whereabouts . Got away with interrogating him in far greater depth than would have dared attempt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , Danni 's field reports . Thanked him ; hugged ' til eyes popped- Went straight home . Despite protests , dropped off Terry . Though would miss baby brother desperately , avians , even large ones ( actually , especially larger ones ) , simply too fragile , too vulnerable to impact . Plus birds in general horribly susceptible to even faintest traces of airborne toxins . ( Remember coal mine canaries ? ) Besides , exotic tropical species tend to be cold-sensitive , and nippy conditions definitely in travel forecast . Withal , unnecessary exposure to potentially fraught situations simply not rational . ( Additionally , in Terry 's case , way too loud for covert enemy stronghold infiltration , recon .... ) However , also had mission-specific reason ( selfish sounds so negative ) : Leaving Terry home ensured that , notwithstanding circumstances , as long as manage to remain more or less conscious , even if just barely , will be able to " phone home " from anywhere on planet . Given destination , not to mention likelihood of encounters with indigenes of unrivaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Terrylink communication might well prove vital : for Daddy , if there ( if alive ) , not to mention Intrepid SpecialOps Girl herself . Made sure birdbrain 's stand provisioned for day . Unworried about featherheaded sibling 's care , feeding , need for snuggles during projected absence ; knew family would love , care for him . Especially Lisa : Adores him ; vice-versa . Plus Kirn 's baby girl shares my mental connection with him-and thereby is linked to me , though in her case contact seems limited to empathy : sensing emotions , feelings , etc . Threw together necessities for trip : weapons , tools . -Oh , yeah ; also food , water , clothing , toiletries , etc . Loaded swag into van . Left note : pro forma apology to Adam , Danni , Teacher , Kim , Gayle . Assigned Lisa responsibility for taking care of Terry . Suggested they might consider keeping eye on baby brother ; take notes if babbling begins sounding relevant . Adjourned thereafter to airfield . Noted , with relief , no one around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet of STOL turboprop Helio Stallions . Identified plane with " youngest " engine ; i.e. , fewest operating hours since major overhaul . Preflighted ship ; everything came up green . Transferred duffle , necessities from van . Fired up , lifted off . Headed north , bound for Canada , Alaska , Bering Strait , **27;595;TOOLONG Urals beyond . Six months in-bleeping-deed ... ! INTERLUDE Archivist 's Note(a) This **28;624;TOOLONG opening passage is typical of the journals kept by young Candidia Maria Smith-Foster , as preserved in the Homo Post Hominem Genesis Library . Typically , when possible in the field , she has updated them at least daily . In an earlier volume ( informally titled Seeking ) , Candy indicated a preference ( only partially , we suspect , tongue-in-cheek ) that her memoirs be accumulated and maintained in an institution to be known one day as the Smith-Foster Post-Armageddon Historical Library and Archives . Obviously , it is too soon in the brief history of our budding species ' civilization to divert those kinds of resources to the construction of a one-person library . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our kind continue at the level of her past activities , such an institution is almost inevitable . . . . Candy has kept her journals in the condensed , cryptic , " pothook " symbols of the once nearly extinct written language known as Pitman shorthand . And though some of us have come to employ it personally nowadays , and its use is spreading , we have translated the original texts into English and typeset them for general consumption . For a classically trained archivist , this has not been an entirely comfortable process ... First , Candy 's narration employs a terse , telegraphic-style sentence structure , omitting almost all but the most necessary of pronouns , adjectives , conjunctions , and adverbs , eschewing what she refers to ( with perceptible contempt ) as " flowery academese . " Then , consistent with that compressed-text philosophy , while she does spell out numbers from zero to ten in accordance with conventional stylebook practice , for eleven and above she employs actual numerical digits . Worse , she not only overuses et cetera , a lazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the abbreviated form , etc. , rather than spelling out the full Latin phrase . Worst of all , with some regularity , she even ( heaven help us all ) employs actual ampersands when stooping to her own , invariably initial-capped , often sideways fractured variations on customary clichs , such as the " Thud &; Blunder " novels mentioned above . Now a personal note : As an archivist who , prior to the holocaust , had obtained his Ph.D . summa cum laude in library science from Yale , a university with generally acceptable academic qualifications , I am also accustomed to functioning as a copyeditor , assisting contributors in the production of clear historical records . Candy , however , has been quite emphatic that each of her words , her every punctuation mark ( or deliberate omission thereof ) , and even her formatting have been chosen with care : Each sentence , phrase , and/or word , initial capped or lower-case , is the precise assemblage of letters which conveys her exact shade of meaning . The actual wording of her instructions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess with my text . " By all accounts , Candy Smith-Foster is a sweet , well-mannered , and particularly well-intentioned child . Each of her instructors report that , in their fields of expertise , she is one of the most attentive , most responsive , and , without exception , fastest learning students they 've ever had the good fortune to mentor . However , in areas in which she herself possesses a demonstrated competence , she does not lack for conviction . And she has a history of getting what she wants , despite the quality or quantity of opposition . I am an academician . Though a hominem , I do not possess a Belt , black or any other color . Accordingly , I prefer that she not become cross with me . Wherefore , I must include this disclaimer : Other than basic translation , transcription , and typesetting of the text from Pitman shorthand into English-and notwithstanding the inherent redundancy of one of her favorite all-capped , ironic selt-descnptives , " Plucky Girl Aviatrix " -nothing in this record has been " messed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candy 's merger of Pitman shorthand with telegraphic-style sentence compression and simplified hasic formatting can not he argued with : The result is a compact , easily transportable , original physical record . More importantly , of course , an expert Pitman writer like Candy can memorialize her thoughts substantially in excess of two hundred words per minute , which encourages detailed journal-keeping , even under the most difficult of field conditions . This , of course , typifies how many of her previous journal entries were made : One entire volume , for instance , was written sealed in a spacesuit , in darkness relieved only by a flashlight , while riding in the belly of that earlier-referred-to bomb-carrying missile . Now , the reader will note that these journals are replete with what , at first glimpse , appear to be impulsive , almost reckless decisions , but which , as events develop , are revealed to have been as well thought-out as the press of circumstances permitted . In this instance , of course , the controlling " circumstances " were that , since Teacher had informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to mount another expedition into the area where her adopted father was reported to have been held , nothing short of imprisonment , behind actual solid bars , possibly in chains , would have prevented Candy from departing immediately to follow-up on that lead to his whereabouts . And even a cursory review of previous journals would suggest that even that might not suffice to stop her for long . Now , for those who may not have had the benefit of earlier volumes , the background basics : We Homo post hominems are the heirs and successors to Homo sapiens . Multiple theories have been offered to explain our abrupt , simultaneous emergence upon the scene at a rate of roughly one of us to every twenty-nine hundred H. sapiens births worldwide . It was Soo Kim McDivott , our discoverer ( and world-renowned pediatrician , child psychiatrist , and anthropologist ; known , of course , as Teacher to every hominem the world over ) who proposed the current favorite : Since the grandmothers of these children were all born within a two-year span , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1918-19 , the " coincidence " fairly shouts its implications : sweeping genetic recombination due to specific viral invasion , affecting either of the gametes before , or both during , formation of the zygotes which became these grandmothers , creating in each half of the matrix which fitted together two generations later to become us . In addition to an apparent complete immunity to the full spectrum of " human " disease , we 're stronger , faster , more resistant to trauma , and possess quicker reflexes . As well , visual , aural , and olfactory functions operate over a broader range and at higher levels of sensitivity than in H. sapiens . As with all of us nominems , Candidia Maria was born to normal Homo sapiens parents . Those parents , the Smiths , were killed in a car accident only months later . Before day 's end , she was placed temporarily with Marshall and Megan Foster , who moved formally to adopt her as soon thereafter as the system permitted . Candy 's identification as a hominem came about through amusing circumstances : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and commented that the living-room wall looked " . . . awful hot . " Testing the surface with his hand , Marshall discovered that she was correct ; that a wiring fault was on the verge of burning down the house . Aware of the newly emergent species from his long friendship and professional association with Soo Kim McDivott , the implications of a child whose vision extended into the fringes of the infrared spectrum could not be missed . They had her tested immediately , and indeed she did prove to be an H. post nominem . Regrettably , however , also just before Candy 's fifth birthday , Megan 's long-inremission leukemia returned with a vengeance . Medical science was unable to stop it , and she soon died . As a result , the child 's bond with Marshall tightened-and vice-versa , we might add : She became , and remains to this day , very much a " Daddy 's girl . " Candy 's phenomenal rate of intellectual development remains an anomaly . She was reading entirely on her own by age two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could add , subtract , multiply , and divide three- , four- , and even five-digit numbers . Teacher suspected that the whipsaw effect of Marshall 's original heel-dragging desire to raise a stereotypically sweet , " normal " little girl , " full of sugar and spice , " quietly opposed by Megan 's determination to supply as much information ( over or under the table , as necessary ) as Candy could absorb on any subject about which she expressed an interest ( and apparently she was interested in everything ) , offers at least a partial explanation of why , according to every benchmark , her progress was well ahead of his experience with members of Teacher 's original AA study population-themselves a substantially accelerated group compared to H. sapiens norms . Accordingly , upon Megan Foster 's death , Teacher moved in next-door and assumed her role as facilitator , while Marshall continued to pretend to act as the public brake . In addition , as one of the few Tenth Degree Black Belt masters of karate on the planet , Teacher also took her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her progress in this field was as phenomenal as her rate of education : She earned numerous championships in her age/weight group . By eleven , her age at the time of the holocaust , she had acquired the equivalent or an advanced high school education with some college . She had mastered math through calculus , some chemistry , had acquired a strong foundation in physics , and had made a good start on college biology . Her progress in karate had progressed to the limits of Fifth Degree Black Belt advancement ; Teacher was in the process of grooming her for Sixth when the Bratstvo struck . Candy rode out the bionuclear attack that ended the reign of Homo sapiens in the large underground shelter beneath their Wisconsin small-town home , which Doctor Foster had built in secret , both for their protection and as a repository for copies of most of the accumulated science and art of mankind . The attack found her reading down in the shelter , alone except for Terry , her macaw , whom she regards , again we suspect only partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the attack , Marshall Foster , publicly a practicing small-town pathologist , but in fact a covert top government biowarfare consultant , had been requested to go to Washington to discuss the deteriorating world situation . Since Washington was one of the few locations on the planet where surface-targeted missiles were used in quantity . Foster was assumed to have been killed outright , along with everyone else within about a thirty-mile radius . Learning after the attack that she was herself a Homo post hominem , Candy set out across a depopulated America to find us , the now-grown young adults or Teacher 's AA group . At this point it occurs to me that , while I 've used the term , AA group , several times already , I have yet to clarify what it means . As a result of Teacher 's exposure , early in his career , to the mixed results obtained by those attempting to rehabilitate children lost , adopted , and raised in the wild by animals of various species ( real-world examples of Kiplingesque children like Mowgli , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate about " nature versus nurture . " He wondered whether ordinary parents , upon producing markedly superior children , might somehow tend to prevent the kids ' development from exceeding their own attainments ; and it that occurred , to what extent the child would in fact be limited . He began a study directed toward identifying gifted children shortly after birth , before this theoretical environmental retardation could begin to have its effect . Various factors were isolated which , encountered as group , proved intrinsic to potentially superior children . Once a sufficient population of them had been identified , the study shifted to phase two . The " positives " were assigned to two of four study groups . AAs ( positive/advantaged ) were potentially gifted children whose parents were subsidized , guided , and assisted in every possible way to provide an optimum learning and developmental environment . The ABs ( positive/nonadvantaged ) were potential geniuses whose parents were n't told of their children 's potential : controls , in other words . At the other end of the scale were the BA ( negative/advantaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe their offspring were geniuses . They , too , received the benefits of AA-type parental support and coaching-but of course the study was double-blind : None of the coaches knew whether they were dealing with AA or BA children . And , of course , the fourth group were the BBs ( negative/nonadvantaged ) ; the true controls : ordinary babies raised by ordinary parents , without interference . As expected , the AAs did well in school ; their progress tended to triple national norms . Further , AA children were well adjusted , with happy , well-integrated personalities . The BAs did well , too ; however , they exceeded national figures by only fifteen percent . Most were happy , but isolated individuals demonstrated behavioral symptoms suggesting they might be being pushed close to or even beyond their capabilities . Perhaps more intriguing were the ABs , who produced very spotty results : The best of them were extremely good , equaling AAs ' figures in certain cases . However , the worst were very bad : The ABs had the highest proportion of academic failures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional upbringing and education reduced many of them to pathological levels of boredom . The BBs , of course , showed no variation at all from national curves ; they were " just kids . " Thereafter , from the AAs and ABs , we Homo post hominems were identified . Ultimately , following a series of vague clues , Candy located us AAs , ostensibly by " coincidence " : having managed to place herself in a location where , when she heard the sonic boom and glanced up , she saw the contrail of one of the few air expeditions to have been sent out , which led her straight to us . As an aside , during subsequent testing Candy has demonstrated a much higher percentage of successful " coincidental " trackings-down of hidden people and/or objects than mere luck would explain . This has led Teacher to postulate the existence of a " tracker " gene . Given the largely unknown commodity that we represent at this point , that probably is as good an explanation as any . In any event , when Candy refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , she 's probably only about half kidding . Following that contrail , she found us all gathered at the Vandenberg space shuttle complex , feverishly working to launch the Nathan Hale , one or H. sapiens , space shuttles , which we had renamed to reflect the tone of its mission . We had learned that the Holocaust had been a product of Russian-based nested conspiracies : First , the Bratstvo , or Brotherhood , whose devastatingly successful plot to use the Russian military 's bionuclear capabilities to wipe out all Homo sapiens other than their own membership-as a mere collateral benefit of the nearly successful effort to eliminate us Homo post nominems before our new species could get a toehold and emerge from its endangered status . Then the Khraniteli , or Guardians : a group of suicidally fanatical Homo sapiens , " true human beings , " of whose existence we had never had a clue until Candy uncovered them and warned us , dedicated to the proposition that , not only were nominems not to be permitted to supplant H. sapiens , but only humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to survive . Concealed and working within Bratstvo organization , the Khraniteli subtly misdirected their puppets ' efforts , leaked their locations , and ensured that the United States ' thermonuclear response to the initial attack would eliminate every Bratstvo installation and operative . This left the Earth to the tender mercies of the Khranitelis own , much more sweeping follow-up purge : Operating through the Bratsvos , they had left a doomsday device in orbit-an unprecedentedly powerful strontium-90 bomb , programmed to commence reentry upon failing to receive a periodic coded signal , the next or which , according to intelligence reports , was due eleven days from then . Unfortunately , it seemed , the contents and radio frequencies were known only to the long-dead fanatics who had triggered the holocaust in the first place . The Hale had been modified extensively in order to reach geosynchronous orbit , twenty-two thousand five hundred miles above the Earth-seventy-five times higher than it had been designed for . The changes left it unable to return to Earth . The crew would reach the missile , disarm the bomb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My only regret is that I have but one life . . . " At almost the last moment , however , it was discovered that the small , powerful , homegrown robot handler that we had been developing to penetrate the missile and disarm the bomb was not up to the challenge . And because the missile 's nine-by-fourteen-inch internal hatches were too small to permit an adult in a spacesuit to reach the detonator and disarm it , suddenly it appeared that our species was destined to join the dinosaurs almost before it had emerged . At that point , however , Candy stunned us all by volunteering to go on the suicide mission . She demonstrated that her diminutive stature allowed her effortless access to the warhead , and that her mastery of hysterical strength , gained during Teacher 's karate training , would enable her to disarm it . Obviously , there was a chorus of protests over the notion of sending a child on a suicide mission , but even more obviously , if our species were to survive , there was no alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was NASA astronaut Harris Gilbert , the mission commander , and Kyril Svetlanov , a Russian Bratstvo defector . Having participated in the design and construction of the bomb , Svetlanov had apparently experienced a change of heart . He was going up to help disarm it , thereafter to die-a most persuasive gesture of atonement . However , once they arrived at geosynchronous orbit and matched orbits with the bomb , the Russian 's true colors emerged : He knifed Harris in the tack , killing him instantly . Svetlanov was in fact a Khranitel . We hominems had been fed persuasive false intelligence about the missile , a delta-winged dart similar in appearance to our own space shuttles , but constructed of the Khraniteli 's wondrously strong new material : Purportedly it was programmed to reenter the atmosphere , belly-land on the open ocean , sink to the Bottom of the Murray Fracture Zone , seven hundred miles west-southwest of San Francisco , and detonate . This would set off a worldwide paroxysm of earthquakes , volcanoes , and a lethal rain of strontium-90 fallout on all unprotected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the missile was targeted to land just offshore of the Vandenberg launch facility . And though the warhead was smaller than advertised , it was more than powerful enough to trigger a tsunami certain to wipe out all the Homo post hominems of Teacher 's AA group , assembled to launch the Hale-yes , the misinformation had been tailored specifically to draw us there . Unfortunately , the data regarding the strontium-90 fallout was accurate : Earth would indeed be uninhabitable by unprotected humans of either variety for the next two hundred years . Only the Khraniteli , in their huge Serdtsevina Rasovyi shelter under the Ural Mountains , massively constructed of the new material and provisioned for the duration , would survive . Day-by-day , however , and despite her hominem heritage , Svetlanov 's admiration for Candy 's self-sacrificing courage and determinedly cheerful spirit had mounted during the week of intensive prelaunch training . With Harris dead , and after having disabled the radios , he felt reluctant to murder her as well , since he could envision no way that Candy alone could possibly complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Harris had never entirely trusted the Russian ; he had deliberately kept him in the dark regarding Candy 's karate skills . And within moments or the mission commander 's death , she had distracted and disarmed the Khraniteli agent with tears-in her words , " surely most abjectly pitiable performance since Bambi calling for Mother in forest fire " -broken his neck , and resolutely assumed responsibility tor the fate of all remaining Humankind . First , of course , she had to disable the bomb . This was the element of the mission for which she had trained , so-apart from the challenge of navigating a five-mile spacesuited orbital transit between the Hale and the missile , for which she had not trained-that was not a major problem . But thereafter , somehow , she had to figure out how to warn us , on the ground , of the Khranitelis existence and their continuing genocidal intentions . The first solution to occur to her was to retarget the missile 's landing site and send a handwritten message down inside it , wrapped in three nested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to that point she had been so utterly focused upon warning us that she had n't even considered her own survival . Only after safeguarding the message did it occur to her that , by riding down inside the missile herself , she might have an outside chance of survival . Naturally , given the missile 's lack of heat shielding , and programmed-in , high-g evasive maneuvering , she barely lived through the heat and battering . Only the fact that Adam and Kim had belatedly realized that Terry 's increasingly nonstop , almost weeklong " spaceflight news coverage " monologue was in fact a direct line into Candy 's thoughts enabled them to follow the reentry drama and be there when the missile touched down at Edwards Dry Lake . Braving significant scorching themselves , they extracted her from the still smokingly hot vehicle . In-flight pounding against the missile 's internal structure had severed her spacesuit 's life-support lines halfway through reentry , and she was clinically dead by that point : Both her respiration and heartbeat had stopped . They removed her from the nested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's utter refusal to stop performing CPR , when it had become obvious to everyone else that she was past any hope of revival , saved her . Even Teacher , whose launchsite radar had picked up the missile coming in over the Pacific , and who , with his team of AAs , arrived in helicopters shortly after the reentry vehicle had touched down , tried to tell him that she was gone . But Adam persisted , and , to everyone 's astonishment , eventually her heart restarted . Of course , in addition to clinical death , Candy had suffered multiple broken bones and extensive first- and second-degree burns . Months of treatment , physical therapy , and resumed karate training led to her complete recovery . .. And to the situation in which we found ourselves at the point at which the current journal commences : Candy had " borrowed " an airplane , and embarked upon what any reasonable person ( lacking knowledge of her determination and skills ) would regard as a Quixotic quest to find and rescue her adopted father . Volume II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , descriptives borrowed , departed , perhaps oversimplify circumstances surrounding expedition 's commencement . But needed plane . And needed at least as much not to be noticed , stopped . Now , historical record amply demonstrates Plucky Girl Aviatrix 's world-class ultralight piloting skills . Not to mention multidozenteen hours logged " flying " shuttle simulator prior to suicide mission to geosynchronous orbit , plus checkout flights in most ships in AAs ' air fleet-okay , not the C-17s ... More pertinently , however , only two weeks previously had availed self of propinquitous opportunity to accumulate just shy of two hours ' pilot-in-command Stallion time when Lennel Palindrome ( how can parents be so cruel ? ) delivered Adam , Kim , Lisa , Terry , Torachan ( Adam 's cat ) , Plucky Girl Explorer herself , up to Sequoia National Forest to retrieve my unstoppably Adam-breathed-upon , four-wheel-drive van , boy 's own luxurious , much-modified travel-trailer , our various camping/travel gear-including ( oh , frabjous day ! ) his favorite gourmet cooking pots , pans , utensils , plus collection of herbs , spices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between his offerings , those of other , merely world-class chefs . After intense coaxing , cajoling , wheedling , and persuasion ( whining imputation , however , rejected as undiluted calumny ) , Lennel let me fly takeoff , outbound cross-country leg ; even coached me through float-down-like-leaf , short-field-mode , practice landing on turf next to runway at destination airfield . Historiographer 's note : To ensure accurate Record for Ages ( not to mention quell malicious gossip ) , Lennel 's decision to yield controls prompted exclusively by lad 's own big-hearted impulses , innately magnanimous nature . Completely unconnected to my rumored promise not to hurt him next time I conducted his Second-Degree Black Belt karate classes .... Mere coincidence , also , that , since equity demanded helping with preflight inspection , refueling upon arrival , postflight maintenance , etc. , such activities enabled concurrent sucking of Lennel 's brain generally regarding Stallions ' care , feeding , idiosyncrasies , etc . Now , unlikely as may seem in hindsight , at that point your Humble Historiographer actually had nothing more devious in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful new toy . Ultralight 's maximum takeoff weight , 525 pounds ; with full fuel plus Intrepid Girl Aviatrix aboard , tips scales at barely 400 . Stallion , on other hand , grosses 6100 . Not to mention unmitigated epinephrine thrill-at full throttle , big bird accelerates like rocket , climbs as if laws of physics suspended . However , at least as compelling , like Mr. Kipling 's Elephant 's Child , Yours Truly always on lookout for opportunities to feed ' satiable curiosity . Pursuit of knowledge never wasted effort . Which maxim 's truth never more conclusively demonstrated than today .... Recently reresurrected Helio Aircraft Company 's latest edition of Stallion bushplane is big , gangly , awkward-looking bird : only a whisker less than forty feet from prop spinner to strobe-capped tail cone , wingspan slightly wider still . Towers nine feet high on extra-tall , so-called conventional tail-dragger landing gear , supported in front by two huge , fat , soft-terrain-flotation tires . ( Clearly , conventional reference in this context purest anachronism : Nose-wheel-based tricycle gear , as seen on jetliners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl Aviatrix acquired initial experience , has long since replaced tail-dragger layout as norm ; but **40;654;TOOLONG configuration still preferred by experienced bush pilots for soft , rough , short , unimproved fields . ) Technically , Stallions rated for two-person flight crew plus eight passengers ; in fact , since solo pilot suffices for operation , can transport nine actual passengers . For this trip , however , prior to departure , unlocked , took out , left behind six rearmost seats in favor of resultant unobstructed floor space , bulk cargo room , extra payload weight allowance . On downside , seat removal provided convenient access to cargo-drop belly doors . When opened , yawning void useful for air-delivering supplies , etc. , should such activities appear on agenda . However , on occasions when must walk across , stand on them in flight , doors ' presence underfoot generates very real ( regardless how psychosomatic ) sweaty , achy sensation in soles of feet , palms of hands . ( Odd reaction , given fact am not particularly phobic about heights per se . ) From Plucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit is advanced aerodynamic technology : Pop-out Fowler slats extending virtually entire length of wings ' leading edges , combined with root-to-tip flaperons ( ailerons doubling as flaps ) produce astonishing slow-flight qualities : Minimum controllable maneuvering speed only 37 knots , or 42.5 mph ; actual stall lower still . Most planes that size already falling out of sky at 70 or better . Which slow-flight characteristics , when combined with 750-horsepower turboprop engine , huge , variable-pitch , reversible , three-blade prop , produce incredibly short takeoff/landing ground runs : just under length of football field ; hardly more than needed by tiny ultralight . STOL : Short TakeOff/Landing-indeed . Aforementioned sophisticated aerodynamic engineering features combined to produce slightly wobbly takeoff ; borderline maladroit performance no doubt exacerbated by haste . Had someone noticed preparations , asked entirely reasonable question , " Candy , what are you doing with that plane ... ? " would have had awkward time coming up with answer sufficiently disarming to send snoop back to minding own business . ( And really hated thought of having to pummel friend to make good escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minimize interception probabilities : Took off more or less directly out of hangar door . Stallions particularly well suited for such highjinks . For all intents , purposes , turboprop warms up instantly . Hit starter , engine spins up to minimum ignition rpm . Light torch-thrill to nifty jet-engine wail as , within seconds , rpms come rest of the way up to operational speeds . Sound level , however , not exactly stealthy ; so prior to engaging starter , had already set prop pitch , flaperons , trim tabs for departure mode : Everything in short-field-takeoff configuration . Wherefore , advanced throttle to stop , released brakes , eased yoke forward . Tailwheel off ground before Stallion fully out hangar door ; plane lifted off without further pilot intervention only two , three seconds later-almost before clearing apron . Banked immediately to establish climb-out parallel to active runway , just in case actual conflicting traffic might be present . ( Not likely ; airstrip boasts three , maybe five non-training-session operations per week . ) Once clear of traffic pattern , climbing away from field ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , did n't take long regain feel for controls . Stabilized , trimmed for standard cruise-climb . Upon reaching manual-listed maximum-efficiency altitude of 13,000 feet , netting 188-knot ( 201 mph ) cruise , burning roughly 50 gallon per hour , leveled off , switched on autopilot . Left ship 's radios turned very much off . Same with pair of borrowed satellite phones . Little doubt what family , friends would have to say . Even less doubt-common-sense arguments , emotional entreaties alike would have no effect on decision . Redundant GPS units operational ; even more satisfying , agreed amongst themselves . Teacher says most GPS satellites can be counted upon to remain on-station , on-line for years to come ; long enough , he feels , for hominems , led by AAs , to develop own space program based on lightweight Rutan-pioneered technology ; take up global-comm maintenance duties ; plus , in time , embark upon further exploration out into Big Dark . Unbuckled , adjourned to improvised navigational station just aft of pilot 's seat . Had " borrowed " one copy of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight across inland Alaska to Bering Strait , along with most of eastern , central , western Asia , eastern Europe . Plus had full collection of applicable GPS-linked 3-D topographical satellite-photo DVDs to load into Garmin moving-map " glass cockpit " big-screen primary flight-information display . Spread out first chart . Rather than following **31;696;TOOLONG coast all the way to Seattle area , point at which Canadian coast bends westward further still , had decided to plot inland-angling , less Pacifically scenic but shorter , geodesic " great circle " course . Quick glance showed route workable : Regularly spaced general aviation fields within reasonable detouring distance on both sides of track . Returned to pilot seat . Inserted first DVD into Garmin . After brief delay while system loaded , digested data , full-color moving map appeared , with cute little you-are-here airplane icon just below screen center . Quick glance out windows confirmed on-screen picture matched geography below . ( Amazing , what scientists can accomplish when not coming up with ever more imaginative ways to eliminate whole sapient species .... ) Even without electronic goodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , have no intention whatever of attempting IFR ( instrument flight rules ) operations . Yes , have demonstrated acceptable degree of proficiency , both in simulators as well as while wearing don't-peek , instrument-practice hood in real planes . However , absent , at minimum , up-to-date weather information from ground-based air-traffic controller , pilot has no idea whether cloud one is driving through is merely local phenomenon-or perhaps zero-zero conditions exist all the way down to unplanned right-of-way dispute with unyielding minerals . Only way to be certain is to fly only when ground visible , meaning VFR operations for me exclusively , thank you very much . Planned to fly short legs only , topping up tanks by halfway point whenever possible . If specific airport turns up dry , will have plenty of fuel remaining to move on . Had had variety of planes to choose from back at Mt . Palomar ; some smaller , others larger ( all the way up to Globemaster Ills ! ) . However , while Stallion larger than would have preferred , advanced aero technology actually simplifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures . Lennel says turboprops way more reliable than reciprocating engines . Oversimplifying proposition to almost comical degree , turboprop consists of only one moving part : turbine/compressor shaft . True , that single piece drives gearbox , which slows 125,000-plus-rpm turbine shaft rotation to 2000-2500 rpm-ish prop speed , as well as driving peripherals such as alternators , etc . Adam agrees with Lennel ; says far fewer modern propjet engines and/or gearboxes fail than piston engines ' exhaust valves-to say nothing of recips ' other eleven moving parts per cylinder ( minimum ) ; plus all those components in common , such as crankshaft bearings ( or crank itself ) , connecting rods , camshaft , pushrods , rocker arms , valve springs , magnetos , distributors , sparkplugs , etc . Of course , regardless which engine type , any failure beyond most minor of causes shifts expedition to Plan B in big way-substantive engine repairs simply beyond 11-year-old ingnue-type capabilities . Wish had Plan B .... And sure wish had dared try to bring Adam . Merrily wicked , irrepressible good humor , coupled with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Plus , of course , boy so useful : Even limited to campfire or crudest gasoline-fueled camp stove , routinely produces culinary miracles ; and , though major aircraft engine blowup might crowd even his talents ( at least without access to fully equipped aviation repair shop ) , can fix pretty much anything . However , company simply not in cards . No question , Adam would have responded to invitation with attempt to stop me . Probably would even have stooped to irrefutable common-sense arguments . When that failed to work ( as if ! ) , favorite boy toy in whole wide world would have dug in heels , shifted to transcendentally superior Male Authority mode : Forbidden Me To Go . ( And according to leading relationship experts , tying , gagging , locking Significant Other in closet prior to departure appears nowhere among top ten recommended couple-bonding strategies . ) Still , would have been nice to be able to count on intelligent , resourceful , fearless backup In The Event Of ... Particularly someone so familiar with the frequently out-of-boxly way Plucky Special-Ops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes leads family , friends , associates to accuse us ( probably no more than half-kiddingly ) of reading each other 's minds . Hmm ... No way to soft-shoe around it , Posterity ; that was digression . Back to Stallion : At least as important as reliability for traveler forced to glean necessities en route , turboprops ' diet of choice : Jet-A/JP-4-staple of civilian passenger/air freight industry/military air fleets . Millions of gallons still conveniently available pretty much worldwide , even at modest-sized general aviation and/or military airports . Toward which end , on-board tool inventory also includes pair of industrial-grade fuel-transfer hand-plumps , with hoses , high-tech filters to remove condensed water , screen out particulates , algae , etc . In interests of historical accuracy , however , Dauntless Girl Flying Ace must confess : Deserve no credit for equipment 's inclusion ; not product of own foresight . Each of hominem community 's planes carries them , since even officially condoned flights mostly involve refueling far afield . Plus , even more critical for under-five-foot-tall airplane thie-er , borrower , inventory includes lightweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ship recessed into upper wing surfaces , tippy-tip-tops of wingtip tanks-all over nine feet off ground ... ! Also brought along additional piece of equipment necessary to accommodate Yours Truly 's " special " requirements : Firm , three-inch-thick , foam block on pilot 's seat enables vision over instrument panel in level flight . More comfortable , as well as lighter ( and surely more professional looking ) , than phone book , which had used during earlier flight with Lennel . Lastly , homemade rudder/brake pedal lift blocks , transferred intact from pedals of own van . Neatly mini-C-clamped into place , pads enable leg-length-challenged pilot ( hey , I resemble that remark ! ) , falling outside designed-for specs , to steer , coordinate flaperons/rudders for smoothly banked turns ; operate brakes when circumstances mandate . Teacher 's bomb dropped just after breakfast . Ferreting out necessary details on Daddy 's probable whereabouts took almost ' til noon . Packing required another two hours . All Stallion maintenance logs kept in pigeonhole shelf unit mounted on hangar wall , so plane selection took only minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocol states , " You fly it , you service it , " could be certain that , unless red-tagged , all ships present fueled , flight-ready . Transferring gear ( including pedal blocks ) from van to plane took half hour . Lifted off , finally , at about three P.M. , leaving only about five hours ' daylight . Night flying ? Thank you , no . Hominem vision extension into infrared fringes not adequate substitute for runway lights during night landings . ( Okay , if had really good reason , might be persuaded to take shot during warm , cloudless , full-moon-lit night . ) Upon reflection , have decided to flightplan for solid , two-hours-before-sundown cushion , just to be sure . Flying weather perfect : Glorious , haze-free , clear blue skies , intermittent fluffy , sparklingly white cumulus puffies ( a few reminiscent of animals ) above , below flight level ; gorgeous panorama of forested mountains , rivers , lakes passing beneath , all the way from Palomar to Klamath Falls , Oregon .

Excerpts from the Journal of Kim Mellon : Really , would n't you think that by now we 'd all have learned ... If there 's one quality that exemplifies Candy 's personality , it 's her decisiveness and determination . -Wait . Sorry ; that 's two qualities . Her resourcefulness , decisiveness , and determination- Damn , that 's three . And - Sorry ; worry scrambles my brain , and of course I 'm practically beside myself at this point , so naturally I sound like a refugee from a Monty Python Inquisition skit . I think what I 'm trying to say is that Candy is n't like other little girls ; not even other Homo post hominem little girls . ( At least I do n't think she is-or maybe I 'm just hoping : Periodically , the recurring suspicion that one day Lisa may be just like her causes my blood to run cold . ) Prior to saving the world ( and before dying even the first time ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least comparable to that of ... of ... Of an adult , obviously . But an adult what ... ? Sugar ? Spice ? Everything nice ? A warrior , of course . Though still essentially a child in appearance , and in her merry , uncomplicated devotion and loyalty to her friends and loved ones , the innermost core of Candy 's soul of souls can not be other than that of a warrior . Yes , four feet , ten inches in height , preteen-nearly prepubescent , for heaven 's sake ! -but clearly a warrior : Repeatedly she 's faced death in defense of others ; sometimes spontaneously , reacting almost without thought , as when she dived into that flaming car to rescue Adam . But that last time ... With full awareness of the consequences , making a rational , calculated , " needs of the many " decision-displaying a courage which to this day brings tears to my eyes to contemplate-she stepped forward and volunteered to die for her newly discovered people . And did . But she 's also killed . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sociopath . The second time , however , the killing was carried out in the coldest of blood : an utterly premeditated execution . Kyril Svetianov , the Khraniteli agent , stood between her and the lives of those whom she had pledged herself to protect . Deliberately , efficiently , she distracted him with childlike tears , got close enough , and then , with a minimum of risk to herself and her mission , she invoked hysterical strength , twisted his neck , and killed his treacherous , back-stabbing , sorry Khraniteli ass ... ! ( Wow . Where did that come from ? I must be even more upset than I realized . ) Anyway , certainly the courage and integrity are inborn , but those life-and-death experiences have ... changed her . Since returning from space ( and , particularly this last time , from death ) , Candy has possessed a certain . . . perhaps awareness would be the closest descriptive of her current outlook , though an adult-level element of confidence is part of it . Now , whether that confidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm barely a First Degree Black Belt and I 've never died , so , in the language of my engineering background , I lack the training , experience , and/or data necessary to express an opinion . In any event , I should have recognized the signs : I actually heard Teacher tell her that they 'd gotten a line on her adopted father . More importantly , I also heard him tell her it would probably be another six months before we could mount another expedition into the area . Then I bumped into Danni coming out of the showers , and she told me how Candy had grilled her for everything she 'd heard about Doctor Foster . However , it was only at dinnertime , when most of us were assembling in the chow hall , and I looked up to see Lisa arriving with Terry on her shoulder , that the dots began to connect , and the first squads of goosebumps started their march up my spine . " Lisa , honey , how come you have Terry ? Where 's Candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a double dose of hominem genes ( my beloved , dearly departed Jason almost certainly was one of us ) , Lisa is one of the most terrifyingly precocious children on the planet . An empath , having demonstrated beyond question her ability to tap into Candy 's emotions , both directly and via Terry 's mind , and almost as certainly mine and others , getting information from her which she feels might upset us can be an exercise in frustration . She eyed me thoughtfully before replying . " Candy 's not eating with us tonight , " she said carefully . " So I thought I 'd bring Terry . " Mm-hmm ... Not enough content to be a lie , and so not responsive to the question . ( Daniel Webster would have gotten all misty-eyed with pride . ) I tried again , my voice dripping a warm , uncritical curiosity-knowing all the while that the tone was irrelevant ; that she was picking up my mounting apprehension directly from the source : " Where is Candy eating ? " Lisa 's eyes hooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cockles of A. E. van Vogt 's slannish heart . This was followed by an even more painstakingly less informative reply : " She did n't say . " By this point , throughout the chamber all eyes were swiveling toward us . Conversation , after the briefest upward flurry , began tapering to a halt . " Around eleven this morning , " Wallace Griffin contributed unhappily into the deepening silence , " Candy dropped by my office and pumped everything out of me but my bone marrow about what we 'd gleaned regarding her dad . She even left with copies of our field reports . " " Which would have been right after she 'd wrung me dry , " interjected Danya , regarding Lisa with that unblinking gaze so reminiscent of a cobra . Whereupon , my daughter found that stroking and scritching Terry required all her attention . Clearly no further assistance would be coming from that quarter . Another pause followed , increasingly pregnant , broken when Lennel Palindrome , our leading aviation maintenance guru , cleared his throat and rose awkwardly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hands of anyone who knows why one of our Helio Stallions executed a remarkably nonstandard departure around three this afternoon ? " he asked . " And is still gone .... " he finished apologetically . The dearth of hands in response was equaled only by the depth of the silence that finally had descended throughout the room , unbroken even by the sound of breathing . The crash of Adam 's chair toppling over ended it . Catapulting to his feet , he leaned forward , arms braced on the table , his face suddenly ashen . Wide-eyed , he glared around the room . " She 's gone ! " he hissed . " You all know she 's gone ! She 's going to fly to Russia all by herself , and then , single-handedly , she 's going to storm the goddamned castle ... ! " Candy ' s Journal : Lovely area , Klamath Falls ; could be talked into living here : Pretty town , prettier surrounding suburbs ; located at southern end of large , lovely lake , among low , heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated among eastern flanks of Cascades , some 60 miles south of Crater Lake . Stallion 's resting angle so steeply noseup , on extra-tall , conventional , tail-dragger landing gear , renders vision straight ahead over nose while on ground effectively invisible . So S-turn taxied ( snatching alternating peeks right , left , to see what lay directly ahead ) over to fixedbase operator facilities . Identified half-full Jet-A fuel truck . Employed hand pump , filters ( ladder ! ) to refuel Stallion . Thereafter performed plane 's bedtime chores : Checked oil , various fluid reservoirs , battery electrolyte level , tire pressures . Removed aerodynamic contamination represented by bugspot accumulations from propeller 's , wings ' , tail group 's leading edges . Carefully washed windshield ( formed from nearly bulletproof , but ever-so-scratchably soft , Lexan ) , etc . Finally taxied over to pretty little grove of trees near airport perimeter . Deployed big T-handle wrench to twist tie-down kit 's coiled-spring stakes deep into ground ; one under ringbolt in each wing , one at tip of tail ; secured plane against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade under starboard wing , cooked dinner on Coleman camp stove transferred from van ; stuffed face until comfortably full . Cleaned up " kitchen " by burying non-breakfast-reusable leftovers . Then pulled out duffle bag containing clothes , blankets , etc. , set down next to big main-gear wheel . Planted tush on bag 's cushion , leaned back against side of tire . Closed eyes , composed , sent off **27;729;TOOLONG message to family via Terrymail . Wondered how much non-message-quality , random stream-of-consciousness , mental activity baby brother had already passed on . Probably mind-numbing duty for poor Terry-monitor-little doubt Teacher would have posted one already . Which caused slight twinge of guilt : AAs perpetually short-handed ; hated to inflict on them need to divert possibly essential personnel to remote baby-sitting duties . But then recalled : Decision to tiptoe off alone to Urals prompted in part by recognition , acceptance of fact could hardly expect Teacher to divert limited resources for mission just to rescue Daddy-assuming even still alive . Viewed in which light , Terry-watching becomes bargain : Nets Teacher additional realtime Urals/Khraniteli intel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Wow , sounds so reasonable , almost believe it myself . ) Settled down , brought journal up-to-date . And suddenly found self temporarily at loose ends , with too much time on hands , reflecting on plans-and at that point could not avoid facing fact that killings almost certainly lay in future . In fact , assuming do n't manage further to martyr self in process , undoubtedly lots of killings . More specifically , lots more killings : Yes , Posterity , despite chronologically tender age , your Humble Historiographer has already been forced to kill . Twice , actually . At which point , despite best efforts , horrific series of memories from astonishingly violent recent past floated before eyes ... On first occasion , Rollo Jones , brand-new acquaintance , had attacked Terry with big iron skillet . Impact would have crushed delicate avian skeleton like balsa-wood airplane model . Now , to be fair , featherheaded baby brother started it . But to be even fairer , fact that situation was allowed to deteriorate to that level was fault of no one but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored portents : Terry hated Rollo . Instantly . On sight . And for years , had never known birdbrain to be wrong about people . Even today , if silly sibling likes someone , invariably new chum proves to be Best Friend material . If not- Wait . Come to think of it , have n't encountered any nots since being invited into AA/hominem community . ( Terry never met Kyril ... ) Rollo , an M.D. , had been charming , funny , obviously terribly smart . And while at least thirty years older than self , was indisputably handsome , in dignified , gray-templed fashion . Plus much of age difference had been spent surviving variety of hostile environments during Peace Corps tour , among other adventures . By any measure , would have been asset . Seemingly more important at the time , however , Rollo only third living soul to cross path since Armageddon ; really had hoped would become friends . So shrugged off alarm bells sounded by Terry 's instant hostility ; allowed acquaintance to progress from introduction to tentative , cautious friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam , self ) -and on that very first " date , " proposed ( or at least propositioned ) ; i.e. , suggested practical arrangement , as primitive societies had employed down through ages : Would pledge his loyalty , years of all-around survival experience , medical training-for access to your Humble Historiographer 's bed . In process of deliberating pros , cons ; actually on point of accepting , largely for Adam 's benefit ( having doctor join expedition could have been of inestimable value ) . But just then Rollo came within reach of Terry for very first time since meeting-and birdbrain promptly bit living daylights out of him . Injury triggered absolutely berserk rage ; if had n't stopped him , Rollo would have killed featherheaded **25;758;TOOLONG in heartbeat . Intervention had required karate , hysterical strength . But pain , frustration at being blocked by child had redirected Rollo 's fury from Terry to self . Still might have restrained attacker without killing , but Rollo big , strong , pretty fast . Hurried me . Ultimately , encounter ended badly . Reaction to killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brood for weeks . Did n't recover fully until Kim ( who , with daughter , Lisa , were fourth , fifth live people encountered after Mankind 's End ) took me aside , administered metaphoric shake , helped set head back on straight . Then came Kyril : bright , fun , good company ; also eminently cuddlable in sweet , fatherly sort of way . But when dust settled , proved to be Khraniteli agent . His people wanted my people dead . Russian stood between me and mine : those whom had volunteered to die to protect . No anger involved , Kyril 's or mine . Nor , on this occasion , stampeded into lethal violence , as with Rollo . Killing Kyril was coldest-blooded , most undilutedly deliberate assassination imaginable : product of thoughtful , if brief , calculation , planning ; methodical execution . No two ways about it : Killing bad . And on indefinable levels , cost of having killed almost worse . However , cost of losing genocidal war worse still . So whatever must do to defend my people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay price , whatever that may be . Same holds at least as true for rescuing Daddy .... Well , gee , glad we settled that . Finally found self reflecting on curious sense of accomplishment , depth of comfort imparted by simple activity of journal keeping . Though begun originally as mere therapy , to drain off nearly suicidal levels of depression experienced while trapped in shelter right after End of Days , since then have more or less come to regard keeping up journals as responsibility-personal Duty to Future Generations . Hmm . . . Hope Plucky Girl Savior of Our People not beginning to believe own publicity . Day I(b) Yes , technically , this should be Day II entry , since being written next morning after having put journal to bed-not to mention minor detail that events about to be chronicled took place after midnight .

However , in view of sunset admirer 's certified nonsleeping status , startlement level delivered by gentle impact on lap from what at first impression appeared to be lightweight , inverted , plastic dinner plate seemed anomalous at best . Eyes snapped wide . As nearly simultaneously as physically possible , looked left , right , and- Found self locked in staring contest , at point-blank range , with cold , almost luminous , ghostly whitish-blue eyes of -Wiley Coyote ... ? Kim Mellon 's Journal : Unfortunately , Teacher 's attempt at calming Adam was begun with the observation , " Now , we ca n't just go rushing off half-cocked ... " But Adam , clearly in the grip of that hyperintense , almost berserker-quality state of focused concentration I first saw the day Candy 's ultralight engine failed and she went down in the Sequoias , was already dashing out the door . Unlike the rest of us , he did n't hear Teacher say , " ... however , Wallace , I have come to the conclusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point are open to question , I think perhaps that her decision was strategically correct . We 've done enough information gathering , analysis , and reflection . It 's time we moved actively against the Khraniteli . If you 'd please organize an expedition for that specific purpose . " " My pleasure , " said Wallace with a wolfish smile . " In general , " Teacher continued , " I 'd like to reduce all their known bases , beginning with Serdtsevina Rasovyi , and the research-and-development facility located there . If possible , I would prefer to recover whatever data it may contain . However , regardless of whether that proves possible , I want it neutralized , and everyone connected with it eliminated as a future threat . " We know that most of the installation is underground , in that huge , so-called indestructible shelter of theirs . If you feel the need to use one or more thermonuclear warheads , so be it . " Of course , at some point Candy will undoubtedly need assistance in determining whether Marshall really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it- " Bouncing up , I forced myself to interrupt ( no one interrupts Teacher-not that he minds ; it just is n't done ) : " Excuse me , Teacher . I 've seen Adam in allout Candy-rescue mode before . He 's impetuous , but he 's not half-cocked : Before he cleared that door , he 'd already decided what equipment he was going to need , and I 'll bet he knows where every piece of it is located . " If we do n't stop him " -I was already headed for the door myself , accelerating to a dead run- " he 'll have it all accumulated , and by sundown we 'll be missing another Stallion . " Jumping up , Danya and Gayle followed me . " How ' bout that , " said Terry from Lisa 's shoulder . " Ooo , " he added so softly that probably only Lisa and I heard him as I raced past her and out the door ; " that cloud looks just like a giraffe .... " Volume III Sidekick Candy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Border Collie almost instantly . Or as nearly instantly as possible , considering ... One : Fact that sun had quite unambiguously retired for evening ; western horizon 's bottommost fringes barely even hinted at pinkish tinge . Which meant Hair-Trigger-Alert Sentrygirl had been dead to world for probably two hours or more ; and ... Two : Dog almost entirely black ; relieved only by minimal white feet , modest chest blaze , narrow collar , slender stripe from nose to just behind flop-tipped ears . Utterly motionless in pool of deeper darkness beneath wing created by slightly oblate moon hanging in crystal-clear , star-studded sky , canine effectively invisible at that moment , except for faintest infrared glowing auras detectible from areas where coat was thinnest ; brighter glow from naked nose , edges of eyelids , outlining- Only anatomical feature really visible : spooky , light blue eyes-picked out by random moonbeam reflected back under wing from polished metal propeller blade . Kim Mellon 's Journal : Gayle runs faster than I do , but Danya runs faster than anyone ; she caught Adam only about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached what I suspected was going to be his first stop : the armory . However , when Danya really wants to speak with you , the sheer radiating power of her personality ( even without an awareness of the potential for dislocated joints and broken bones to underscore the effect ) makes it difficult to ignore her . Far more quickly than either Gayle or I could have managed , she gained Adam 's attention and suggested he return with us to what was obviously about to turn into our first expeditionary planning session . " Do n't you even think of skipping out ahead of us and running your own operation , " she told him sternly . " Wallace is going to want to arm-wrestle me for you , but I 'm asking first : I need your fix-anything , mad-scientist talents on my team when we go in . " Danni is so good . She could n't have picked a better stratagem . No hint of the " You young idiot ; you 're just going to get yourself killed ! " mom-style , common-sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deaf ears of a mission-bent berserker . No ; with a perfectly straight face , Danni addressed him on the level of " us professional rescuers , " one to another : Teacher had just authorized a preemptive strike , we were going in to carry it out , as well as to help Candy get her dad out-and , she , Danni , needed Adam on her team to make it all work . I 've never encountered anyone , whose construction included Y chromosomes and normal concentrations of testosterone , whether Homo sapiens or H. post hominem , who would n't have responded to such a matter-of-fact request for assistance from someone who looks like Danni with other than improved posture , a significantly expanded chest , a piercing , look-of-eagles expression , and a heightened overall aspect of manly determination . Of course , at least equally important , by " drafting " him as part of her team , giving him mission responsibilities , and letting him know that she and we all are counting on him , Danni has also minimized the likelihood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a relief . I love Adam almost as much as Candy does , and he 's a terrifically talented young man . In his fields . But the fact is , special-operations skills and hand-to-hand combat simply are not among them . He is nowhere near Candy 's level . Heck , even I 'm better at it than he is . There 's no doubt in my mind that , if he tried to go in on his own , he 'd get caught in a heartbeat . Candy , on the other hand ... Even before beginning to train under Danya , Candy had much the same focused , thinking-all-the-time quality to her gaze as her tutor ; and the more time she spends with Danni , the more she reminds me of our ex-Mossadniki . Since then Danni has repeatedly confided to me that Candy is a natural-born ninja : Her talent for special-operations work , such as infiltration and stalking , are unmatched . Danya says that , since taking her under her wing , Candy 's learned to move with utter silence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's ever met . As a Sixth Degree Black Belt , Candy was already approaching her coach 's skill level in hand-to-hand and non-firearm-type weapons ; but according to Danni , our lethal little sister has become an even better shot than she , a Mossad-trained professional sniper/assassin , ever was , particularly with the big rifles at extreme long range . In short , under normal circumstances , the thought of an eleven-year-old girl prowling the Urals , stalking Khraniteli in their own territory , would be terribly distressing . In Candy 's case , however , similes involving wolves in sheep 's clothing fall almost blood-chillingly short . A more appropriate comparison might be something on the order of a wistfully helpless-looking Golden Retriever puppy-which transforms in the blink of an eye into a tiger . Or perhaps more accurately-a velociraptor .... Danni 's only halfway tongue-in-cheek term-of-art for this phenomenon is the exploding baby bunny surprise : an adult adversary 's momentarily confused hesitation upon the sudden discovery that within this innocent-appearing , small-for-her-age , apparently vulnerable , winsome , preteen girl dwells a supremely well-trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intellectually , based on the above , I know that her chances of pulling it off are comparable to those of Wallace or Danya working alone . Possibly even better , actually , on some levels , because of the Q-ship factor . Except , of course , for the language : They speak it like natives , but Candy 's command of Russian is limited to about fifty words ; with , I 'm told , an atrocious American accent ; most of it having to do with spaceflight and disarming orbiting doomsday bombs-an inventory of dubious utility on her current quest . All of which raises the question : If she 's like this now , what 's she going to be like-Heaven help us all-when she grows up ? If she grows up ... Candy 's Journal Dwelling on 300-plus acres located not quite five miles outside Wausippi , small Wisconsin town where Daddy/Momma Foster-then Daddy/Teacher-raised me , Weldon Helmrick was independently wealthy gentleman farmer . As part of operation , Helmrick ran commercial milking parlor . Sort of . Yes , did raise cows . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all ) to pay for upkeep on 200-plus really contented ( some almost borderline-obese ) Holsteins . Mostly , however , Weldon pocketed huge governmental subsidies for not operating anywhere near capacity , lest someone in government have to figure out how to avoid feeding excess to Third World poor . ( Hmm ... Really must stop getting diverted into these side issues . Not as if matters ; those people all dead now-starving victims , soulless governmental dogs-in-the-manger alike . ) Point toward which your Humble-if-Scatterbrained Historiographer was tacking so obliquely , even prior to inadvertent digression into sociological-injustice rant : Weldon 's actual motivation for keeping cows in first place was so his Border Collies would have herd of their very own to play with . ( Weldon called it " training " ; may even have believed it himself . ) Breeding , competing in herding , obedience , agility , tracking , catching Frisbees , plus occasional foray into conformation breed ring , were focus of joyous dilettante agriculturist 's lifework . As well , with such outlook , served as state coordinator for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population at Helmrick homestead seldom dropped below 15 , 20 : four , five of his own ( more when one or more females had puppies on ground ) , plus 10 , 20 rescuees being fostered , resocialized , retrained , in transit from/to old/new homes , etc . In point of fact , Weldon spent virtually every waking moment working , playing with , loving his dogs . ( Fair number of sleeping moments , too , based on Yours Truly 's experience with Alpha , oldest daughter . Yes-Heaven help them-Weldon named kids in order of arrival , as if two-legged pack members . He and wife had made it up to baby girl Epsilon ( ! ) by Armageddon time . Seldom did any family member , or overnight guest , experience less than " three-dog night " -and can testify from own experience , actually pretty cozy arrangement during frigid Wisconsin winter nights .... ) Alphie one of my best friends . Helmrick farm seriously fun place ; spent considerable time there . Got to know Border Collies well ; formed favorable impression . Confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk to featherheaded twin posed by sharing abode with 45 pounds of spring-steel- and sinew-powered , obsessive-compulsive canine with herding instincts generally operating at Warp Nine , might well have worked on Daddy to get me BC puppy of my own . Or , more likely , grownup rescuee . Weldon repeatedly told me would have given us Really Good Deal : his cost for one of his own pups-but free , if chose rescuee . Weldon had much in common with beloved breed : unreasoning , monomaniacal focus on joys of pursuit of one 's passion . In his case , Border Collie ownership . In BCs ' case , monitoring/controlling movement of any-/everything nonstationary , heading off any single critter departing from group , gathering scattered components of whatever description together in one place , sorted by related subgroups , etc . Weldon oblivious to demands in time , training , personal attention ( beyond what most people could begin to devote ) required to keep intrinsically hyperactive breed happily , constructively-i.e. , **25;785;TOOLONG . Felt no one should be without BC of her very own ; several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are most intelligent quadrupeds have ever encountered . Not just my opinion ; according to literature ( as well as Weldon ) , dogs from good working bloodlines ( as opposed to ruined , bred-for-pretty-only breedring types ) have IQs comparable to five-year-old human children ( mindbogglingty focused five-year-old human children ) : capable of abstract reasoning , deducing answers from indirect evidence , operating independently once assigned projects . From own observations , never doubted assertion for a moment . However Have also listened to many of Weldon 's horror stories- " hilarious anecdotes , " in Weldonspeak-of consequences of permitting Border Collies to succumb to ennui ; each tale delivered howling with laughter at inventiveness , originality-sheer scope of mischief involved ... Narratives of owners who , upon waking from naps , found every single ball in entire house arranged in neat circle at feet . Or every kid in neighborhood tightly huddled in group at geometric center of front yard , most crying , all afraid to move . Or cats all clustered in living room corner , looking really outraged ( yes , cats can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be outstanding herding prospect , ended up in Rescue shortly after purchase by misguided housewife-lady owner , who only wanted nice , quiet house pet , but had heard BCs were " really smart . " Two weeks after bringing home nice , quiet ( really smart ) house pet , at last having been worn down by dog 's nonstop unblinking do-something-now stare ( referred to by proud Border Collie cognoscente as The Eye-used by BCs to intimidate , work their will upon i.e. , bully cows , sheep , goats , livestock generally as well as cats , neighborhood children ) , misguided owner put dog out in fenced backyard . Alone . In empty yard . With no toys . Nothing to do ; nothing to hold interest-but especially no company ; no one to play with ... Owner returned hours later to find vinyl siding all removed from house 's rear wall to uniform height of six feet . Apart from pulled-through nail-head holes , siding undamaged ; just removed . And stacked . Likewise , bark stripped to same height from every tree within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another farmer returned home to find barn completely jammed full of cows , with Border Collie still determinedly working to pack last few in . On one occasion Weldon offered absolutely straight-faced opinion : Crop circles actually product of BCs relieving boredom . And , of course , standard response to " How many Border Collies does it take to change a light bulb ? " " Only one ; but while he 's at it , he 'll take out the garbage , empty the vacuum , defrost the freezer , repaint your house , ' upgrade your wiring , and defrag your hard-drive . " This Border Collie regarded me with almost sapiently aware , analytical expression , hyperalert intensity , joyous expectation of Good Things to Come typical of sound working bloodlines . Reached out hand , allowed dog to sniff knuckles . Then offered caress followed by scritch . At first touch , dog trembled momentarily . Then moved forward , pressed against me . Lowered head into lap . Trembled again . Sighed . Then whimpered . Well . . . No one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Plucky Girl Adventurer dissolved ; dog and I shared good cry together over her long-lost family . Held close , scotched , stroked her all over .

Inspected collar detected during snuggle session . Unsurprisingly , proved to be high-quality ( i.e. , expensive ) leather , with brass plate , reading ... Fairwinds ' Bagpipe Supercharged Magneto Ch OTCh , HCh , MAX , ATCh , TDX , TD " Well , look at you , " I snuffled damply into dog 's ear , reveling in sensation of marvelously soft coat against cheek .

So what 's your calling name , sweetie ? Magneto-did they call you ' Maggie ' ? " " Maggie " lifted head ; focused The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opened mouth slightly , uttered soft , almost unvocalized bark . " Ah-hah , " I replied ; " ' Maggie ' it is . " BC stood , The Eye intensifying further . " So what have you been eating all this time , Maggie ? Are you hungry ? I feel ribs , but there 's some meat on them , so obviously you 're not starving . To stay even that well fed , I 'll bet you 're a terrific mouser and death on rabbits . Let 's see what we can find in the canned , not-running-for-its-life section ... " Took Frisbee from lap , set to one side ; stood . Maggie snatched it up , backed up one step , watched intently . Began to drool . Rummaged through supplies ; dug out can of turkey Spam ( no sneering , please ; turkey variety actually pretty tasty ) . Removed lid , extracted contents onto paper plate , set on ground before her . Maggie sat ; directed The Eye up at me expectantly . Then more intently . Expression grew concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned : Sometimes Weldon trained dogs to wait for permission ; sometimes not . Individual decisions generally based upon dogs ' intensity levels ; in particular , whether setting down dishes involved risk of fingers being swallowed along with first mouthfuls of food . Other breeder/trainers merely considered it investment in canine good manners . Stroked head , said , " Okay , Maggie ; take it . " Though a guess , must have been right words , or at least combination included enough of them to appease hungry dog 's conscience . She offered single appreciative wave of tail , carefully set Frisbee down next to plate-then did n't so much eat as inhaled contents . Improvised water dish for her from Frisbee . She drank gratefully . Then glanced up at me , picked up Frisbee , dumping remaining few drops . Walked back to my side , lay down . Set down Frisbee . Then watched me . Eyed her thoughtfully in return . Clearly Maggie brilliant , superlatively trained dog . Could be significant asset on sortie like this-though figuring out what cues original owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BCs routinely learned upward of 75 individual commands , verbal as well as hand signals . But also presented complications . For instance , air travel-on longer legs , with autopilot engaged , Intrepid Girl Flying Ace could use onboard potty located in tiny lavatory at extreme rear . Maggie could not . Her endurance levels might well cap flight durations . Plus would need to add appropriate canine food supplies to larder . Not to mention worrying about her when on ground , lest she get in trouble with local wildlife-or even inadvertently betray me to Khraniteli once we get there ... Decided to give it a shot in morning , using some of Weldon 's standard commands : come , sit , down , heel , stay , go out , to me , etc. , along with usual related hand signals . Then could decide whether to keep her . Was on point of inviting her inside plane for night when it occurred to me : Did n't even know if new four-legged friend housebroken-having just eaten , drunk , might well , as Terry so colorfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given physical perfection , obvious training levels , seemed unlikely in extreme ; but if by-products managed to seep below deck , where could n't be reached for cleanup , would not improve plane 's ambiance during balance of trip . Glanced around ; noted weather : lovely cool , clear night . Decided would sleep outside with her under wing . If still around come morning , would get serious about making up mind . Pulled out sleeping bag , unrolled , slid inside , cushioned head on pair of folded jeans . Glanced at BC . Seemingly before " Maggie , here , " cleared lips , dog already in motion : Glided over , moving in that marvelously slinky , head-low , feral gait characteristic of breed . She lay down close , leaned against me . Put arm over her . She sighed . Briefly got all teary-eyed again , thinking about how long pup had been on her own , missing her people , after humanity vanished . Poor baby . Maggie pressed against me , closed eyes , whimpered briefly , sighed again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of soundest sleep . Found self sitting bolt upright ; eyes wide , staring , trying to focus ; head snapping right , left , mentally scrambling to collect widely dispersed wits . Slightly bloated half-moon had set long since ; even darker now-but could make out half-circle of black silhouettes made somehow darker-looking by faint infrared glow highlighting noses , triangles of almost bare skin along edges of pricked ears , eyelids outlining occasional baleful , greenish-yellow flicker . Beasties , whatever they were , glided back , forth some 20 , 30 feet away . And between them and me-Maggie : head down , shoulders hunched , looking twice actual size ; shifting slightly back , forth ; always between closest marauder and me-and making even worse noises than they were . Eased Glock from low-slung , tied-down , special-ops ( personally , regard it as " Lara Croft-style " ) , carbon-fiber holster as slid out of sleeping bag , mentally apologizing to weapon for earlier uncomplimentary sentiments regarding discomfort intrinsic to wearing heavy , lumpy thing to bed . ( Yes , small-frame Model 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gun , but even small pistol conclusively bars sleeping on that side , and not much more helpful turning over that direction . Not that silencer in fitted scabbard on other side likely to be mistaken for comfy improvement ... ) Groped for Maglight with left hand , gratefully recalling had n't reset from wide-beam-much more useful at close quarters than spot . Flipped switch as rose to feet . Dazzlingly white quartz-xenon flood bloomed out , picking out scene 's every detail in starkest contrast : Five Big Bads , eyes glowing bright yellow-green in light-even smallest wolf twice Maggie 's size , but she never wavered , never retreated single step toward me . One round in chamber , 15 in extended clip . Decided to risk single warning shot , in hopes flash , bang , sudden explosion of soil beneath leader 's nose would disconcert , inspire her/him to lead pack away , seek more cooperative larder . Because really preferred not to kill wolves if could avoid . Exemplary , mating-for-life , environmentally beneficial species . Excellent parents ; take equally good care of own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lore , not wanton mass murderers of grandmothers or red-hooded children . Generally cull herds ; take older , sicker , weaker specimens , or less-well-cared-for babies . ( Hello , wolves ! -do we look like any of above ? ) Actually , primary diet consists of mice . Had no intentions , however , of participating in menu variation . Nor permitting Maggie to . Seemed words barely forming on lips- " Maggie , here ! " -before felt BC pressing against leg ; simultaneously squeezed off shot at dirt just below leader 's nose . Hydra-Shok 40-caliber slug drilled into soil , expanded in mere inches ' penetration to nearly ten times original diameter . Only direction energy could go at that point was straight up . Dirt exploded into wolfs face , traveling at many tens of feet per second . Undoubtedly broke skin dozens of places ; no doubt burned like dickens . Regardless , whether because of muzzle flash , pistol 's roar , or landmine effect under nose , leader yelped , leaped back . Instantly I jumped forward to capitalize on broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaaah ! " -and squeezed off two more earth-boring rounds under noses of next largest and/or most aggressive specimens . Success : Attack terminated . Wolves broke off ; retreated back across airfield toward woods on far side . Dropped to knees , gathered Maggie in arms . Hugged trembling form ; scritched The Place ; rubbed/stroked head , ears , tummy ; generally praised her to high heavens for saving skin . Was rewarded by appreciative slurp up cheek , happily wagging tail . Well , all righty then ... One-woman Eurasian supercontinent invasion force may learn slowly , but not complete dunce . Gathered up camping gear , tossed into plane . Threw sleeping bag in through door . Turned back toward Maggie , intending to lift her aboard ( door sill easily four feet off ground ) , only to watch her soar effortlessly over my shoulder , in through opening , carrying Frisbee . By the time managed to swing self aboard , Maggie sitting smugly in midst of tumbled sleeping bag , tongue lolling in doggie grin . Closed , secured door . Checked time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . Pulled bag from under Maggie ; BC heroine thought procedure quite funny : Briefly crouched , pounced , tail wagging . Only belatedly did happy thought occur to me : Maggie not gun-shy ; warm pressure against leg never so much as twitched in reaction to Glock 's repeated thunderclaps . However , first things first : Before climbing into sleeping bag , popped out weapon 's magazine . Used cute little Glock-supplied , patented pry-tool to squeeze in replacement rounds . Slapped magazine back up into gun butt . Debated briefly . Only three rounds used . With any luck , would be half past forever before needed to fire weapon again . However , combustion products , barrel deposits should not be allowed to fester . Decided to field-strip , clean in morning . Slid weapon back into holster . Then dug out M-1 carbine . Older weapon , but fits me better than more modern AR family . And for normal shooting ( i.e. , targets this side of horizon ) , prefer it to giant , much heavier , Barrett 50-caliber super sniper rifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overlapping . Slid one end up into receiver . Yanked slide to charge chamber . Set safety . Placed weapon next to sleeping bag . Close . Then slid in-and suddenly , without seeming to have moved , somehow Maggie lying next to me again , pressed close , chin resting on shoulder . Put arm over her . So close , could feel quivering , panting from residual fear , excitement , adrenaline . Which pretty much summed up own feelings . Quite some time before fell back to sleep , holding My Dog .... Day II ( Officially ) Felt all cozy and not-alone this morning as drifted up from slumber . Noted that , though Maggie still snuggled against side , under arm , dog 's chin no longer rested on shoulder . Suppressed smile . From Weldon farm experience , knew where chin was ; knew what awaited me upon opening eyes . Tried to get away with squinty cheat-peek , but did n't work . Very instant eyelids quivered-busted : Maggie kissed me squarely on nose ; prevented from expanding attentions only by quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet spooky , pale-blue , delighted canine gaze regarding me from six inches away . Unblinkingly . Intensely . Just short of manically . Classic example of The Eye , trying to get me to get up ! Do something ! Visible over BC 's shoulder , happy tail waved gracefully . Maggie definitely morning person . ( Though if anything like Border Collies of previous acquaintance , also afternoon person , evening person , night person ... ) Before opening door , retrieved M-1 . Told Maggie " Wait " ; exited first . Performed quick 360-degree scan to make sure wolves not having second thoughts about breakfast . Heard Maggie 's feet hit ground behind me as got to ohk point in " okay " -and marveled : BC 's response time nothing less than incredible . We adjourned to adjacent bushes . Smiled over Maggie 's uncaninely modesty . Then realized : Following wolf encounter , had completely forgotten housebreaking issue . Nice to know would not be issue . Shared some more turkey Spam for breakfast : One can for new mommy , one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do tend to be confusing-or , if one thinks about them too deeply , downright disturbing . ) Used Maggie 's Frisbee for water dish again . She drank , but quickly snatched up when done , dumping balance . Eyed her thoughtfully . " You 're really attached to that thing , are n't you . " BC spun , fixed me intensely with The Eye , projecting : Do it ! Debated ; seemed likely object of stare was she hoped big sister would throw Frisbee for her . Began , " Would you- " Only to find dog already had executed perfectly aligned front-and-center , " tucked " sit ( resembling four-legged version of stiffly " braced " ten-hutttt ! posture so beloved by dearly departed military establishments ) , front toenails barely six inches from Reeboks . Arrival comprised of single , eye-blurring , twisting bound . Nudged me in leg with Frisbee . The Eye intensified , sparkled . Tail wagged . Grinned down at her . " I 'll interpret that as a ' yes . ' " Accepted proffered disk . Then wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from heel - Another blur ; Maggie now sitting at right side , again perfectly lined up , but also leaning forward , almost quivering in anticipation . Dog seriously proficient student of body language , I thought . Said , " So am I supposed just to throw it , or should I have you stay , throw it , then release you ? " Decided just ( she crouched ) to throw it . Unlike majority , who use backhand , away-from-body flip , am sidearm Frisbee ace : Grip rim like pencil , between thumb , index finger ; thumb on top , straightened index finger lying along curved inner rim groove . Sidearm motion spins disk off fingertip ; generates much faster rotation , more lift , nets way more distance . But directional control can be tricky . Drew back , let fly-and surprised to find Maggie already 50 feet along intended flight path , running flat-out , well ahead of Frisbee but headed for likely eventual landing site . However , as often happens with sidearm technique , disk begin to tilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in correct direction . Must have been tracking flight path by audio ranging . Maggie slowed to let Frisbee overtake her . Bore slightly off to one side ; only then glanced up , snatched out of air with precise sidelong snap , slid to stop . Concluded retrieve with another perfect front-and-center stop , practically dancing sitting still with joy , excitement . Second time , momentarily held her with stay command as threw Frisbee . Upon release , Maggie accelerated like rocket , overtook disk maybe 200 feet out . With Frisbee soaring almost horizontally , some six feet above grass , Maggie launched skyward , nailed it midair ; then raced back again . Gave hereditary new Best Friend half hour 's worth of Frisbee chasing before announcing " Last one " prior to final throw . ( Another useful Weldonism : Formally declaring game 's end just prior to conclusion helps familiarize BCs with concept of limits ; reduces likelihood of activity becoming endlessly obsessive/compulsive addiction . ) Thereafter , with M-1 leaning against leg , field-stripped , cleaned , lubricated , reassembled Glock . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; strolled across field to fixed-base operator 's facility . Sampled various vehicles ; found aged International Harvester station wagon with charged-up battery , nearly full tank . Checked yellow pages for holistic/organic pet supplies ; amazed to find EarthPets outlet in such remote , if lovely , backwater . Maggie loved riding in car : Not headout-window type ( would n't have permitted that in any event ; eye injury risk from bug strike outweighs fun ) , but sat up very straight on seat , watched intently as scenery went by . Smiled nonstop . Prybar proved unnecessary ; store unlocked . Surveyed inventory . Scrutinized food labels . Ultimately selected brand with artsy timber wolf logo ( friendlier looking than last night 's visitors ) . Came in several flavors ; primary protein nutrients listed , respectively , as lamb , bison , caribou , venison , chicken , salmon-and specified actual meat cuts ; not hooves , hak-with rice , together with healthful , selected herbal mix . More importantly , contained no ingredients impossible to pronounce , nor patently toxic preservatives ( butylated hydroxyanisole BHA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with nutrition prior to World 's End by virtually all Big Name grocery-store dog food manufacturers-despite having been shown in studies to promote liver disease ; related also to tumor production , dozens of other ultimately fatal conditions . Likewise , since health food doggie-din-din oven-baked , not extruded , contains no **35;848;TOOLONG , cumulative toxins . Final additional benefit : Packaged in forever-airtight foil/plastic bags , ruling out hideously toxic aflatoxin mold contamination . Offered Maggie taste-test on the spot . Bottomless mobile appetite put away heaping cupful ; seemed to find flavor acceptable . Fixed me with roguish sidelong version of The Eye , hinting without detectible subtlety that additional samples would be at least as acceptable . Tossed dozen 50-pound bags into wagon . Figured at three , four cups daily , ought to carry her for expected few weeks ' absence ( with modest six-month reserve , just to be safe ) . Gathered up bunch of containers of chewable vitamins , omega-3 complex fish oil capsules-figured if good for me ( Teacher says so ) , good for new baby . Also took along dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nothing but little cubes of ( surprise ? ) freeze-dried beef or chicken liver . Experience with Weldon 's dogs suggests most canines regard flavor as little less than spiritual experience . After test , Maggie concurred here , too . Collected several easily cleaned stainless steel dishes for water , feeding . Next , since could foresee circumstances in which might need to limit Maggie 's movement for her own safety , picked up selection of short leather leads , couple 25-foot " flexi " recoil reels , spare nylon buckle-on collars . ( Recalled Weldon 's **47;885;TOOLONG opinion that no one who actually knows anything about dog training uses choke collars-and especially not potentially larynx-damaging metal-chain chokers ! ) Finally , picked out nylon seat-restraint harness . Resembled sled-dog harness . Carefully adjusted straps to fit . Locked onto car ( or aircraft ) seatbelt/shoulder harnesses , would provide whole-body support in sudden stop . Ultimately , Foster sisters departed KIamath Falls around noon , headed for Bellingham . Only two-hour flight . Last stop before departing Lower 48 . Maggie untroubled by harness ; perhaps reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , wear it only for takeoff , landing . Rest of time allowed her to wander cabin at will . However , appears to like flying every bit as much as car riding . Spent majority of time sitting up in copilot 's seat , peering out windows , nudging me for occasional scritch . And smiling . Bellingham stop uneventful . Landed ; fueled , serviced plane ; ate . Then experimented briefly with Weldon 's voice commands , hand-signals . Pleased to discover Maggie knew every single one ; responded flawlessly , no matter what maneuver asked her to perform . Pleased but a little surprised : Not unreasonable to expect itinerant , lost-and-found BC to have regarded some of WeIdon 's commands as puzzling . " Classical " herding system developed originally in Scotland ; command structure tends to serve as boilerplate pattern worldwide . However , by the time trainers have brought dogs to Maggie 's level of performance , most will have developed own unique variations on theme . But apparently Maggie 's owner/handler had trained under same grand master who had influenced Weldon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No foolin ' ; if had been working with actual sheep , cows , could have had them square dancing in five minutes . Maggie that good . Rewarded BC thereafter by playing Frisbee with her for two solid hours before bedtime . Maggie breathing almost normally by conclusion , eyes still laughing . By contrast , elder sister 's throwing arm nearly ready to fall off . Plan to take off for Ketchikan at first light . Tad over 600 miles ; easy three-hour hop . Only challenges relate to potential pitfalls facing unlucky aviatrix in event of engine failure : Canadian west coast pretty much unsettled even prior to depopulation . Road count on nonexistent side of few . What towns existed were mostly **25;934;TOOLONG . Far between . Terrain unforgiving : wrinkly , largely fjordic ; multiple " arms of the sea " outlined by jaggedy cliffs , mostly low but heavily forested mountains . Cruise-line-frequented waterway , euphemistically known as Bellingham-Ketchikan Marine Highway , wanders among mountainous offshore island chain extending from . . . well . . . Bellingham to Ketchikan . Most popular views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenic cliffs , etc . But darned little in way of emergency landing accommodations for distressed aviators . If get to Ketchikan in time to fuel , service plane by noon , Anchorage only four hours ' flight beyond . True , slightly longer hop ; will burn two-thirds of fuel load as opposed to half . But still well within absolute , no-reserve , 1200-mile cruising range , and can not imagine finding less than unlimited fuel at Anchorage . Of course , if Ketchikan stop should take longer than expected , will just spend night there ; move on in morning . Not as if have schedule . Only considerations are weather , daylight . ( Ketchikan . **29;961;TOOLONG . Tee-hee-fun word . Ketchikan ... ) Hmm . Guess am really tired . Good night , Posterity . Day III Wonder if Northwest Canadians , Alaskans ever tired of being surrounded by gorgeous scenery 24 hours a day . Possible , I guess . Personally , in no danger of satiation yet . Every time turn head , see something else just too darned beautiful for words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes , rivers-and more mountains , glaciers , forests , oceans , etc . ... Ketchikan experience rivaled do-it-yourself NASCAR pit stop : Brim-full Jet-A fuel truck with charged-up battery ( even came with own ladder ) parked right there on ramp adjacent to fully stocked parts department . Fueling took ten minutes ; topping up fluids another three . Except for potty break , lunch ( and hour-long Frisbee session for you-know-who ) , could have been back in air in 15 minutes . As was , departed Ketchikan by 11:00 ; touched down in Anchorage just before 3:00 , where found another Michelin Guide five-star , **33;992;TOOLONG airport . Spent three hours prior to dinner , even before Frisbee session , taking advantage of local , fully equipped , bush " airline 's " service facilities to give Stallion extra-thorough going-over in preparation for tomorrow 's 600-mile-plus flight over trackless Alaskan interior wilderness . Destination : Wales , small town , smaller airport , at very point of Bering Strait ( Alaskan Airports Guide describes accommodations as " basic , " but promises ample supplies of Jet-A ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , gearbox lubricant , plus hydraulic fluid for constant-speed prop , extra fuel &; oil filters , igniter components , etc. ; sorts of goodies unlikely to be found in abundance if find self nonscheduledly parked in unmarked clearing at heart of Alaskan outback , much less amidst desolation sure to encounter on far side of Strait . Final step : Uncased , assembled massive Barrett 50-caliber sniper rifle . Had debated whether to bring huge , almost cartoonish weapon at all . Grosses , for heaven 's sake , almost half what Intrepid Special-Ops girl does : Manual lists 34.6 pounds . Feels even heavier in field , but that 's attributable in part to five-pound contents of Wallace 's custom-fabricated 20-shot magazines , stuffed full of **25;1027;TOOLONG , quarter-pound cartridges . Standing on end , rifle only inch shorter than self : 57 inches from butt to muzzle brake . Under most circumstances , less than ideal weapon for 11-year-old-all I can do just to hold it up , using classic freehand stance : standing , butt against shoulder , front grip supported ( ha ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sights long enough in that position to hit anything at any distance . On other hand , weight not unmixed curse : All that mass , combined with recoiling barrel and extraction-action assembly cushioned against cleverly opposing spring and buffer mechanism , in addition to remarkably efficient muzzle brake , does sop up incredible amount of recoil . Net effect only little more punishing than 12-gauge shotgun . Which is to say , plenty to dump unprepared 85-pound shooter on duff , as learned first time fired one freehand . ( Danni 's imperfectly suppressed smile more annoying than belly-laugh-never happened again . ) As practical matter , however , only way can shoot this ( only technically portable ) personal field-artillery piece accurately is prone or from bench rest , using built-in bipod muzzle support , or , standing , with height-adjustable post-and-crotch pole holding up noisy end . However , notwithstanding gripes , really have come to enjoy firing Barren . Under Danni 's supervision , have garnered modestly encouraging results : With big scope , no-wind conditions , shooting prone or bench , have repeatedly achieved three-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . ( Danya does her quietly frightening best to conceal inappropriate pride over preteen apprentice assassin 's previously unsuspected aptitude for **37;1054;TOOLONG homicide , but somehow always does seem to come up in conversations with her colleagues . ) However , monstrous bangstick 's presence on mission not due merely to anticipated need for long-range slaughter . Motivation far more basic . Yes , Posterity ; Candy Smith-Foster-Intrepid Girl **25;1093;TOOLONG , deathly , just plain terrified of polar bears . ( Okay , can stop laughing now . Hey , not kidding-traumatized young person here ! ) See , expedition 's itinerary calls for spending several nights in Ursus Marittmus ' territory . Beginning tomorrow . Now , to be fair , never been attacked by polar bear . In fact , never actually even met one in person ; not even in zoo . However , overtime , neurosis-motivated research has turned up far more information regarding big white eating machines ' attributes than ever wanted to know . And for whatever reason , ever since earliest childhood , giant , flame-eyed , tusk-studded , saliva-dripping , shaggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , more lastingly psyche-scarring , recurrent nightmares . Few of life 's experiences are less restful than whole night spent fleeing in slow motion through pink , baby-blue , and fleecy-white cotton-candy arctic terrain ( somehow always in neighborhood of towering , red/white-spiral-striped , candy-cane-style North Pole ) , with 11-foot-long , 1800-pound , highly intelligent , single-mindedly hungry carnivore nipping unstoppably at heels . ( All right ; nipping unstoppably-usually wearing futuristic , wrap-around Foster Grants . Often with WWI flying ace 's silk scarf around neck . Sometimes adorned with jaunty beret ; alternating with menacingly ghetto-style backward baseball cap . Once showed up on Plucky Girl Psych-Eval Candidate 's trail wearing classic Native American full war bonnet . ) But always smiling . Always drooling . Always licking lips . And never more than three floatingly slow-motion bounds behind .... Practical bear-related consideration for lugging Barren along on expedition , however , is fact that smallest , least motivated adult polar bear on planet could rip open Stallion 's lightweight aluminum structure easier than I used to pop open Happy Meal boxes . ( Ooo ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that image . ) Now , manifestly , odds on hitting charging white ursine freehand at any real distance comparable to winning PowerBall . ( Remember ? Back when lotteries existed ? ) But if should spot mobile appetite approaching in time , can use post-and-crotch support . And even freehand , if target shows too much interest , gets scary close-absodamntively guarantee 20 two-inch-long , half-inch-thick , Hydra-Shok-type expanding slugs , each traveling at almost 3000 feet per second , will drain enthusiasm from biggest , baddest , hungriest ( most stylishly attired ) polar bear in or out of my nightmares . However , regardless of explanation ( rationale ? excuse ? ) , no doubt whatever , big gun 's presence-assembled , loaded , conveniently at hand-will render tomorrow night 's stopover at Wales ( and subsequent three , four nights in northern Asia ) more restful . As will Maggie 's wonderful , ever-twitching canine nose , marvelously sensitive ears . Day IV Held off departure until nearly ten to give ground fog time to burn off . ( Maggie did n't care : Leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for Frisbee . ) Finally launched into horizon-to-horizon crystal dear blue sky , settled down on course for Bering Strait , tiny seaside community of Wales . Once again , Alaskan vistas simply breath-taking : Air so clear , snow-capped Mount McKinley &; Associates in sight for over an hour ; from shortly after takeoff to well after passed abeam , receded astern . Much gorgeous mountainscape to admire . Thereafter , terrain began to descend , level , transition to endless expanses of solid forest , speckled with hundreds of lakes , multiple traceries of rivers . By focusing attention narrowly ( i.e. , ignoring virtual nonexistence of safe potential emergency landing opportunities for non-floatplanes ) , one could regard landscape as very pretty indeed . Now , technically speaking , turbines ' strictly rotary components do n't actually beat . Addressing issue metaphorically , however , Stallion never missed one . Leveled off at optimum 13,000-foot cruising altitude . Airspeed edged up to 188 knots , though GPS true-speed readings showed Arctic Circle tradewinds cutting into groundspeed by nearly 35 knots , making trip take longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exited from tip of peninsula dividing Norton Sound from Norton Bay . Actual over-water flight no biggie ; hardly twenty miles . From altitude , could have glided to dry landing from any point in crossing . Comparable , in fact , to contemplated Bering Strait passage : Two potentially wet-feet legs of 24 , 22 miles respectively , with pair of small islands , Diomedes , at halfway point . Followed by official Siberian Welcome Station : " All the seal blubber you can eat .... " ( Okay , yes , made that last part up . ) Anyway , barely an hour later found us circling Wales area at low altitude , admiring ramshackle collection of small buildings comprising pair of adjacent colorful ( in desolate , barren , seashore-tundra sort of way ) northern Alaskan small towns ( Wales , Kingegan ) , cute little landlocked lagoon , tidy little airstrip ... ( Oh , all right ! Yes , scouting for polar bears . Happy now ... ? ) Landing uneventful , apart from Maggie 's demonstration of how observant she is ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( airborne ) Road : Fuzzy sister dozed in back as I spent final half hour gradually letting down from 13,000-foot cruise to 500foot height-above-ground altitude for local wildlife survey prior to landing . But very moment decided to initiate approach , reached for flaps , trim controls to set up approach , canine cohort returned to copilot seat in single bound ; then , without coaching , settled tush on cushion , leaned against seat back , thereby assuming position for convenient harness reattachment . Mind you , Posterity , only her third flight . Known people who did n't learn that quickly .... Based on geographic coordinates alone , Wales lies only four and a third longitudinal degrees farther north than Anchorage ( 65 37 ' N vs. 61 13 ' N ) . Turns out , however , geography and weather employ degrees in very different fashions-at least 30 real-world degrees colder here . Nippy temperatures combined with seriously raw onshore breeze to drill through every gap in clothing , real or imagined , moment set foot outside plane . Though reasonably confident , following aerial recon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard with M-1 in case of wolves , other smaller predators , while Maggie took advantage of convenient modesty bush for postflight relief . Shivering from head to foot by time made it back inside plane . Rooted through duffle , dug out first planned stratum of warmer clothing : flannel-lined denim jacket , pants ; poofy thick socks . Chilly temperatures hardly unexpected , given locales through which course necessarily leads , so have made advance preparations . As we skirt Arctic Ocean ( for roughly next 2,000 miles ) , will add additional layers to trousseau as goosebumps mandate : longjohns , flannel shirts , sheepskin-lined leather jacket . Several additional layers available , up to all-out Eskimo stealth mode : camo-colored , down-filled , hooded parka , matching pants ; insulated snowmobile-type gloves , boots . Maggie , on other hand , was n't part of predeparture planning . Eyed her thoughtfully . Notwithstanding fairly widely held opinions of ignorant , uneducated ( also questionably sapient and thankfully now dead ) **35;1120;TOOLONG pet owners of yore , nothing inherently coldproof about dogs . In fact , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 , foot protection becomes increasingly necessary to prevent frostbite . Resolved to keep close eye on canine companion as mercury sags ; improvise stylish puppy jacket from some of my stuff if necessary . Smiled then . Wondered how temperate-climate-raised , fleet-footed , furry Best Friend would view chasing Frisbees while wearing sled-dog-style , fur-lined booties . My reflective gaze returned by mischief sparkling from The Eye ( technically , both of them ) . Maggie snatched up Frisbee . Wagged tail . Looked hopeful . Unblinkingly so . For the moment at least , concerns clearly wasted . Capersome canine obviously finds current brisk temperatures invigorating , if not downright enjoyable . ( Of course , to be objective , Maggie finds wakefulness invigorating , worthy of unflagging , gleeful enthusiasm-unblinking stare .... ) Day V Despite surroundings , potential unwelcome guest list ; despite night spent clutching Maggie in one arm , Barren in other , managed not to dream of polar bears . However nattily attired . Unfortunately , morning turned out to be not only below-freezingly brisk , but proximity to ocean , absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on propeller , wings , tail group airfoils ; fuselage , windshield , windows-everywhere . With no way to de-ice . Save by handscraping every square inch of aerodynamically active surfaces ; not to mention windshield-which latter component would have emerged from experience scratched opaque beyond usefulness . And while personally have never encountered icing conditions during brief if intense piloting career , Lennel , as well as ( during week 's shuttle training prior to orbital mission launch ) , Harris and others with real experience , did share war stories ; cumulative impact of which thoroughly canalized Plucky Girl Flying Ace 's psyche regarding Evils &; Potential Consequences of Flying in Icing Conditions . Moral of every one of which could be summarized tidily : Do n't ! So waited until nearly noon for temperatures to rise sufficiently ( if just barely ) above freezing ; first to melt , then evaporate every nubbin of frost adhering to every square inch of all flying surfaces : wings/flaperons , stabilizers/elevators , vertical fin/rudder , prop , plus windshield ( the better to see through you , my dear ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship 's belly . But not of aerodynamic significance ; not about to wait forever . Besides , really wanted to get Bering Strait behind us while weather gods smiled , however coolly . Retain unpleasant memories of pre-Armageddon TV special concerning hazards of commercial fishing in northernmost Pacific . Narrator described activities as most dangerous job in world : Freakish , all but unpredictable meteorological conditions-frequently **26;1157;TOOLONG ocean temperatures , together with almost randomly shifting winds ; waves so confused , due to many nearby land masses , as to all but moot expression , " weather patterns " combine to make chances of survival in event of sinking , or even man-overboard , equate to wishful thinking . Prognosis similarly bleak for passengers of aircraft forced down into wind-tossed , gunmetal-gray , frigid waters . Nonetheless , with head held high ( posture mandated partially by need to see over Stallion 's instrument panel ) , maintained stiff upper lip whole way across . Though could not help trying to " sit lightly . " While Maggie napped . Volume IV If Today is Tuesday , This Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially hostile terrain especially so ; " hostile " in this context referring to dearth of relatively level ground upon which to execute emergency landing-issue quite separate from natives ' intentions . Remaining at 13,000 feet would improve nonscheduled landing prospects , likewise allow overflying modestly upthrust terrain with reasonable degree of safety . However , higher we fly , more we face risk of radar detection-or unfriendly eyeballs , for that matter , particularly if weather conditions at altitude cause Stallion to emit contrail .... Staying low , on other hand-say 1,000 feet or less above ground-cuts down on naked-eye/microwave detection hazard radius , but also minimizes opportunities to come up with clever solution , identify survivable landing site , in event aircraft suddenly becomes very quiet . Which brings up related problem : Turbine 's wail at cruise , though different from reciprocating engines ' drone , most unlikely to be heard on ground from optimum altitude , whereas down low , depending upon wind direction , engine noise audible for probably five , ten miles both sides of flight path . Contemplated factors , rolled dice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots longer . Will be detouring around , f'rinstance , any bodies of water spanning more than about five miles across , since wo n't be high enough to glide to safety In Event Of ; plus , of course , for same reason , need to follow flattest terrain available ; i.e. , no adventurous mountainpass flying .... Accordingly , at halfway point between Diomede Islands and Siberia , started gradual altitude bleed-off . Gauged remaining height ; kept enough in hand , as closed on coastline , to be able to glide to dry land from any point in descent . Completed overwater passage 's final mile just 1,000 feet above wavetops . First Siberian soil to pass beneath wheels : easternmost tip of barren , semi-mountainous wart of tundra projecting toward Americas from equally barren eastern end of Chukchi Peninsula . Crossed surf just north of ghost community listed on charts as Naukan . Adjusted flight path northwesterly as we came ashore , aiming generally for point where Bering Strait coast bends southward in vicinity of little town named Enurmino . First , though , course briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after landfall , Bering coast angled off southward , leaving us headed inland . Route soon converged upon , intersected with , paralleled Chukchi coastline , which served as almost geometrically straight-line VFR navigation aid . First leg , from Wales , Alaska , USA , to Izba Tynupytku , Siberia , totaled some 400-plus miles , as crow flies . Not , however , flying as crow . Because not crow . Am , in fact , " the very model of a modern major , " er , aviatrix . ( Sorry , ghosts of Messrs . Gilbert/Sullivan . ) Cutting-edge-advanced , GPS-linked , big-screen " glass cockpit " primary flight-information displays offers many advantages over old-style **32;1185;TOOLONG navigation . Among benefits : emancipation from punctiliously steered compass courses connecting points A , B. With GPS-linked PFID , always know where we are ; never lose basic orientation between self , ultimate objective . Can weave , wander , meander , juke , dido , dodge to , fro to heart 's content to stay over relatively favorable potential emergency landing terrain , all the while remaining aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Following careful chart study , have determined best bet is to hug coast until all significant mountain ranges lie behind us ; until can lay nearly great-circle course for south-central Urals without having to cross significantly rough , inhospitable terrain . Probably not coincidentally , most settled areas in these desolate regions , not to mention airports at which can fuel , service plane , seem to have grown up along coastline , though charts reflected sprinkling of villages along rivers in more inland locations . Shortly after regaining coast , crossed two more bays opening onto Chukchi Sea . First hardly more than tidal lake ; second resembled low-sided fjord . Neither triggered elevated " over-water " blood pressure . After passing Enurmino , some 50 miles farther east , coast curved more westerly , then broke up into string of low , almost barrier-island-type formations separating bay/harbor on left from Chukchi on right . Not quite 50 miles beyond that , we hop-scotched out along another sketchy chain of islands leading most of the way across bay sufficiently long , broad to have been named on charts : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostrov means island . Name probably refers to rocky landmass near bay mouth . Transliterated Russian chart identifiers consistently unhelpful in that regard . Hate being , in effect , functionally illiterate like this ... ! Thereafter course edged back north to coastline , following chilly gray surf along another string of barrier islands , which played out at little town listed as Ryrkaypiy , which marked tip of big , scallopy bight off Chukchi Sea , necessitating brief westward detour . Arriving shortly thereafter at Izba Tynupytku , first performed low , slow , vicinity flyover , local polar bear survey . Determined none in immediate proximity . Landed , fueled , serviced , tied down plane . This far north ( 69 , 15 ' north latitude ) , summer days lots longer . Despite just under five hours ' flight since icing-delayed noon departure from Wales , landing at Izba Tynupytku found sun still well above western horizon . ( Actually , more on order of north-north-northwestern horizon . ) So had dinner , conducted protracted Frisbee session by way of apologizing to Maggie for long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raw , horrid , cutting-to-bone breeze driving off ocean-which , despite all this " Chukchi Sea " nonsense , really is no more than southern fringe of Arctic Ocean . ( Somewhere out across which , according to more authoritative Old Wives ' Tales , Norse gods invented , handed down original concept of cold . ) Day VI Good morning , Posterity . Happily ( seldom has adjective been so narrowly focused ) , though temperatures overnight dipped into teens , relative lack of humidity ( despite ocean 's proximity ) mostly prevented frosted-up wings , windshield : patch here , speckles there ; nothing worth delaying takeoff for . Maggie got me up shortly after sunrise . We had breakfast followed by another Frisbee session . Frisbees fly well in dense air generated by subfreezing temperatures . On other hand , Frisbees thoroughly slimed with dog spit seriously cold to bare fingers ' touch . Thank heavens for foil-pouched Handi Wipes . Periodically throughout session , checked Maggie 's feet . But no signs of frostbite ; no diminution of enthusiasm . Guess weather still within BC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Added several additional layers of clothing , but suspect will never be warm again . Turbine fired off promptly despite bracing temperatures , then we launched again into blue . Planned midday destination this time much closer , in as-crow-flies distance : Rauchua , at mouth of good-sized river ( do wish chart-makers had bothered to identify smaller landmarks ) , only about 300 miles in straight line . But huge bay in between necessitates detour ; actual flight distance closer to 450 . Siberian coastal tundra , even with low mountainscape generally visible on left , Chukchi Sea dominating view on right , not most inspiringly scenic vista have ever overflown . Usually when flying low , candid glimpses of wildlife on ground , opportunity to observe otherwise inaccessible terrain , keeps interest piqued ( or arguably , around mountains , peaking-or even peeking : down into long-gone residents ' backyards ) . Regardless of spelling , however , flight over tundra generates little interest . Endless flight over rolling , essentially featureless grassy expanse terminating in surf pounding at rocks on one side , blending with age-softened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to apex of list of Sights Without Which Life is Not Complete . In fact , staying awake actually became issue . Switched off autopilot ; hand-flew for several hours just to keep eyelid margins above pupils . Was a bit surprised to discover how closely coastal mountains regularly approached water 's edge . In places , safe emergency landing sites not as abundant as expected , though nowhere nearly as scarce as along Canadian/Alaskan west coast . However , turbine continued to wail ( more a hum , actually , inside cabin ) ; miles continued to tick off , 200 every hour ; and eventually we came upon , then detoured around , huge bay ; landed at Rauchua well before noon . No polar bears there either . Shortly after takeoff , skinned past mountain-wannabe ridge reaching almost to water 's edge at seaside town labeled Dvurechye . Bent course slightly southward at that point to skirt broad bay into which huge Kolmya River system emptied . Thereafter , terrain became slightly more varied : laced with streams , dotted with lakes . Crossed another major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ultimately dead-centered Shevella airfield , located at point at which Indigirka River 's delta commences . Landed , serviced , tied down plane . Ate . Frisbeed . Went to bed well before sunset . Day VII First half of morning 's flight was over territory reminiscent of Alaska 's northwestern outback : endless expanse of patchy plains , forests , speckled with lakes , streams . We hooked around tip of big V-shaped bay opening onto More Laptevykh ( yet another euphemistic attempt to make Arctic Ocean sound warmer ) . Hugged coast all the way to town called Sokol , on point of land beginning Lena River delta : massive sprawl of channels , islands , etc. , which also ultimately dumps into More Laptevykh . Performed routine polar bear sweep ; landed , serviced plane . Ate , frisbeed Maggie . Launched again . Terrain desolate as followed Lena 's westernmost main channel to exit into More Laptevykh at Ulakhan-Krest . Then headed just south of due west across mostly fertile-looking flatlands , landing some 800 miles later at Chmaya , on Pyasina River , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ' flying time , called it quits for night . Kim Mellon 's Journal : If I were a proper mother ( or maybe even a decent person ) , I would never even have considered taking Lisa with us on this mission-I mean , she 's six , for heaven 's sake ! However , unnatural mother and terrible person that I am , it never occurred to me , until much later , even to question the fact that everyone , including Lisa herself , had simply , unquestioningly assumed she 's going . After all , Terry is fulltime mindlinked with Candy ; obviously he 's going so we can keep track of her . And Lisa , mind- and emotion-linked to him , usually is able to clarify Candy 's ofttimes cryptic Terry-relayed observations , as well as her sometimes even more ambiguous dictated communications . In addition , of course , in the absence of our favorite , if most worrisome , adopted sister , Lisa is the primary designated caretaker of Candy 's " retarded adopted twin brother . " So of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than earning her passage : Almost single-handedly my amazing baby daughter has been monitoring and memorializing Candy 's progress via Terry 's mindlink during our superkid sister 's every waking moment virtually since she left . Lisa has n't tried to cherry-pick what to record ; she has taken down in Pitman shorthand every single word to come out of Terry 's beak since Candy 's departure . Like long-departed court reporters of my past acquaintance , her theory , is that we can discard anything which , upon leisurely review , we conclude is merely the product of Terry 's everyday rambling ; however , she points out more than a little snidely , it would be difficult in the extreme to retrieve something that had n't been written down but which we might realize , after-the-fact and only dimly remembered , was in fact Candy-related . Thanks to Lisa 's efforts , we know where Candy is within a fair degree of accuracy , as well as how her expedition is developing . If everything goes as planned-hers as well as ours-we should get there in time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as retrieve her foster father . Toward that end , Adam has thrown himself into the operation with an intensity that those who have n't had previous occasion to observe him in one of these nonstop berserker states find at least eye-opening , if not actually a little alarming . He 's joined Kelli Watts and " Watts " Washington Kelly , our two best particle/wave scientist/engineers , and me ( I was an electrical engineer Before , specializing in computers ) , in the care and feeding of the **30;1219;TOOLONG installations aboard the Globemasters . If it were n't for the tension , working with Kelli and Watts would be almost too much fun . They 're a visually spectacular , pepper-and-salt couple who maintain a deadpan running joke based upon the potential confusion arising from their names : an " assumption " that no one can tell them apart-this notwithstanding their relative pigmentation ; she 's one of the darkest-skinned people I 've ever met , whereas he 's an Icelandic blond whose hair , in direct sunlight , is probably visible from orbit . Apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really ) would be a treat , because people who are as smart as he is always bring out the best in him . Somehow the implied competition hones his talents : His concentration intensifies ; his eyes become almost predatory ; his processing of available information begins to blur the line between deduction and augury . In this case , in only three days ' " tinkering , " with hardly more than an opportunity to learn his way around the hard- and software , he 's achieved a significant increase in static suppression and signal isolation , which in effect boosts monitoring range and signal discrimination . Of course , Adam 's primary , unblinking focus is on finding Candy , keeping her out of trouble , or , if things have already progressed beyond that point , rescuing her , so those competitive tendencies are further sharpened by his nearly berserker-level intensity . Then there 's Adam the gourmet chef : Age notwithstanding , the boy is simply one of the finest chefs on the planet . According to Candy , all he has to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sniff contents , and somehow everything tastes better . Originally I thought she was engaging in hyperbole ( no ! -Candy ? ) , but thereafter I personally witnessed the phenomenon , had the opportunity gratefully to sample the result , then found myself almost in mourning over the realization that we 'd eaten it all . Needless to say , therefore , everyone is delighted that he 's also helping Kinsella Woodson , one of our food-services magicians , retool the big planes ' on-board galleys to feed the couple hundred or so of our people who are going along during what 's expected to be a protracted field operation , and he 'll almost certainly participate regularly in food preparation . ( At which point I can almost hear Candy interject , " And the crowd went wild .... " ) On the actual mission-planning front , Teacher , Wallace , Danya , and Peter have spent the past several days going over everything we know about the Khraniteli and their Serdtsevina Rasovyi base , and teasing ever-finer resolution from satellite imagery . In one recent photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the driver of an open vehicle not wearing a hat , but that he 's attempted a comb-over and really should n't have . However , thus far they have not seen anyone who might be Marshall Foster . Not counting the thermonuclear warheads , which , regardless of how safely they 're packed , we all tend to give a lot of elbow room , it takes a great deal of materiel-weapons , ammunition , selected combat and cargo vehicles , spares for the planes , as well as living supplies-to fill up a C-17 , never mind two of them , but provisioning is well under way . We 're scheduled to leave tomorrow at noon . At the C-17s ' four-hundred-fifty-knot cruise ( which translates to almost five hundred twenty miles an hour in my more old-fashioned frame of reference ) , the voyage will take about fourteen hours ' actual flying time . And though the cruising range of one of these flying behemoths is about five thousand miles , Wallace plans two conservative runs of about twenty-five hundred and three thousand miles each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a major Russian military base with which he 's had experience . A thousand miles after that will bring us to Kamensk-uralskiy , a civilian airfield located only some hundred fifteen miles from Serdtsevina Rasovyi , which he and Danya have selected as our operations center . Between refueling and maintenance , the stops will add a good four or five hours to the trip . Still , if everything goes as planned , we should arrive in-theater at about the same time Candy does . Then , eavesdropping via Terry , we 'll zero in on her and , as Danni expressionlessly puts it , " invite " her back into the fold and keep her out of trouble while we locate Doctor Foster , if he 's there , and clean out that Khraniteli nest . Sure . That 's just how it 'll work . I mean , it 's not as if there 's any potential for something to go wrong .... Volume V Welcome Wagon Candy 's Journal : Day VIII This is bad , Posterity . Too early in mission to be getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's security implosion ? Maggie woke big sister shortly after sunrise . Stretched , extracted self from sleeping bag . Retrieved M-1 , popped open door , descended from ship , performed customary 360-degree , hungry-fauna scan , with usual negative results . Thereafter , yawning demurely , scratching elegantly , rifle dangling absently from one hand , stumbled over to little environmentally friendly recycling pit excavated previous evening amongst scattered bushes/trees demarking airport 's border . Almost before Yours Truly had managed to undo belt , allow dignity to drop around ankles , Assume Position-and catch breath from initial thrill after brisk Siberian morning zephyr 's caress raised goosebumps on skin unaccustomed to such familiarity-Maggie had completed own business without recourse to pit ( " Real dogs don ' nee ' no steenking pit " ) Thereafter BC frisked back , companionably plunked down within convenient scritching distance , settled in to wait for slower-starting human metabolism to complete appointed rounds . Thereafter , while passing ... er ... time , peeled off appropriate length of tissue , and , following brief wrestling match with breeze , managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue packet on top , with Swiss Army universal appliance weighing it down . Then transferred attention to horizon , concentrated on thinking tranquil thoughts , attaining that all-important thousand-yard stare . Had time to wish had brought book . Just finishing personal tidying-up phase when noticed Maggie 's tail had shifted into high gear ; plus BC 's attention seemed to have switched from usual fond-if-intense gaze at elder sister to characteristically focused working-dog stare at something located beyond my shoulder , when - " Good morning , " offered softly rusty-sounding male voice from somewhere behind me . " I love mornings , do n't you ? The colors are so bright and vibrant , and every breath is full of the scents of the night . " Only just managed not to fall backward into pit during burst of enthusiasm surrounding abruptly refocused attention . In single motion , readjusted trousseau while scooping up M-1 . Spun as rose , one hand leveling rifle , snapping off safety , seeking target , while other hand , in fumbling , distinctly after afterthought , buckled belt . Whereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly rotund , white-haired , -bearded , somehow elfish-looking individual , seated some thirty feet away on clever one-legged golfing stool/cane , rifle slung across back , faced three-quarters away , currently engrossed in elaborately detailed study of far horizon , apparently in deference to Plucky Girl Adventurer 's prior state of dishabille . " I think , " mused new acquaintance wistfully , speech betraying no more accent than someone raised just up street from own house in Wausippi , " that of our regular imports , I miss the softness of that lovely American toilet paper most of all . " With which , apparently picking up my movement from peripheral vision , stranger rotated slowly on golf seat , like slightly worn , gnome-on-a-stick weathervane . Happy smile lit face as completed turn , our eyes met ; not so much ignoring M-1 lined up on center of mass as apparently uninterested . " Please forgive me , " he said in tone conveying more amusement than apology , " for startling you . With my attention directed away from you , I misinterpreted the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . The intrusion was unintended . " Let me introduce myself : Long ago , my parents , the Rozhdestvos , named me Otekh . However , by the end of my first few decades of operating the toy factory , people tended to call me Igrushka Izgotovlenie , which in English more or less means Toymaker . Then , of course , as I grew older , they began to call me Otets Igrushkayami , which translates loosely , though almost as compactly in English , to Father Toys . I suspect either translation will roll more easily off your American-educated tongue than either my name or the Russian versions of my nicknames . " Opened mouth to interject question ; then realized Father Toys ' cheerful rambling covering much of what would have wanted to grill him about anyway . " Passing through the area late yesterday afternoon , I noticed your aircraft 's approach . And may I say , " he added , cocking approving eye , " your landing was very smoothly executed . My own sorely missed corporate pilots could have done no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alertness , weapons , and your evident skill in handling them . It seemed to me that suddenly appearing and approaching might alarm you , to our mutual detriment . So I remained out of sight , and also stayed downwind to be certain that your dog would not scent me . For the balance of the evening I merely kept watch , to be sure neither of you would be surprised by a bear or wolves . In the absence of poachers , the populations of both have begun to recover nicely in this region . This can be a mixed blessing . " After you reentered your plane at sunset and failed to come out again within a reasonable interval , I assumed you had gone to sleep . I spent the night on a surprisingly comfortable couch in what once was the airport manager 's office . " Early this morning I returned , settled down here at what I hoped you would regard as a sufficiently nonthreatening distance , and waited quietly for you to waken , emerge , and notice me . My hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us through introductions without incident . " Russian smiled apologetically . " And indeed , just as I planned , you appeared and promptly headed my way . I thought you had seen me . I was just about to introduce myself-when your sudden swoop placed me in a most awkward social position . " Could not repress giggle . " Not as awkward as mine . " Despite best intentions , found self cautiously warming to Father Toys . On subtle levels , reminded me of Harris , Wallace , Teacher , other older AA males . Grin spread across Father Toys ' slightly cherubic features . " I shall not debate the issue . Beyond any doubt , there was ample awkwardness to go around . " But at that point , one of those endlessly fretting , loose-ends-noticing brain cells , with which have been saddled practically from birth , awoke , contributed observation : " Wait . Before I said a word , you greeted me in English ; you called me American-educated . How did you guess that ? " Russian 's smile widened further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettering and numbers on your American-manufactured Helio aircraft . Here you are-forgive me ; I mean this as a compliment , not as condescension-so young but flying a comparatively very large airplane all by yourself . After landing , you immediately fueled and serviced it . By yourself . Only thereafter did you play with your wonderfully clever dog . After you both ate , you went straight to bed without displaying more than a security interest in your surroundings . " All in all , yours were not the actions of a tourist ; someone merely exploring or wandering randomly . Your conduct could hardly have been more businesslike . Obviously , in today 's depopulated world , someone of your age , so serious , heavily armed , so obviously capable-you are on a quest . " Toymaker 's eyes twinkled. " -Where but America could you have come from ? " Did n't quite scuff toe aw-shucksty in dirt . " Uh ... thank you . " Curiously , something about Toymaker-demeanor perhaps , or maybe appearance-motivated Plucky Girl Quester to remember manners at that point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's nice to meet you , Mr. Toymaker . " Which certainly was the case from Maggie 's perspective : BC had already migrated to sit at new Best Friend 's side , chin on knee , enjoying what appeared to be old gentleman 's autonomic scritching in response . And , though still proceeding cautiously , found was beginning to agree with her : Father Toys one of those people who are just intrinsically comfortable to be around . Obviously invited him to join us for breakfast . Unsurprisingly , accepted with grace . To Maggie 's delight , company inspired Plucky Girl Flying Chef to go a bit beyond usual A.M. culinary efforts : Pulled out powdered eggs , last of bacon from travel fridge , pancake mix , syrup ( not that BC got any of latter goodies ) ; dug out , fired up Coleman . As we chatted , and I enjoyed cozy sensation of cooking for , sharing with , someone other than self ( and Maggie , always ready to share ) , found Danni-implanted interrogation lessons edging toward fore : First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before lowering guard all the way . So by way of " making conversation " ( i.e. , priming pump ) , observed , " You said you were ' passing through ' the area yesterday afternoon . Are you exploring or just wandering randomly ? " Laugh-lines surrounding Father Toys ' eyes crinkled with delight . " Wonderful , " he responded happily ; " you actually heard what I said . At your age . I wonder if you can appreciate how rare that was , even among adults , back before people became an endangered species . " I am , of course , searching for survivors . Originally the process did almost constitute random wandering . However , in the months since I began , I 've found there is a tendency for the same factors to affect where people live today as those that influenced the original establishment of most settlements in pioneering days . First , one needs water and reasonably decent soil . " Hence my presence in Chemaya : The Pyasina " -Father Toys made vague gesture toward broad stream just out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second river . I have already enjoyed some success while making my way northward down the Yenisey : I found eighteen people , almost evenly divided between genders , ranging in age from slightly younger than you to about my age . Since transferring my attention to the Pyasina , I have located two more , one of each . I invited them to my home in Mikhalva , in Kraznoyarsk , southern Siberia . So far all have accepted . " I live on a very large farm on the river . In the bad old U.S.S.R. days , it was a collective , so it has accommodations for many , as well as a wide variety of tools , equipment-a broad spectrum of resources . It seems to me that the more of us we can band together , the better our chances of survival , particularly if we can establish a viable , self-supporting settlement . " Likewise " -for briefest moment Toymaker 's intrinsically merry expression faded- " it will be less lonely .... " It appears , " he continued in somber tones after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three percent of the world 's population have survived the plague . " " The actual figure is on the order of three and a half hundredths of a percent , " I blurted , without thinking . The Toymaker paused , eyed loose-lipped Intrepid Girl Expert Interrogator thoughtfully ; then mischievous smile crept back across features . " So confident a delivery of such a precise number from someone so young . . . perhaps there is even more to you than appears on the surface , remarkable as that seems . " Okay , Posterity ; clearly had blown cover . Decided to throw caution to winds ; provide full disclosure , but thereafter drill straight in for key information . ( Hoped revelation would not prove mistake . As just plain likeable as Father Toys appeared to be at first impression , did not look forward to having to terminate relationship " with prejudice " ... ) " I suspect there 's more to you than you suspect , too , " I replied obliquely . Fixed him with unambiguously gimlet eye . " Have you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter . " Oh , my goodness , yes ! Within a day of the holocaust , I became so ill that I thought I would die , too . For a week I could keep nothing down ; for a day I could n't even raise my head . " Barely had time to wonder whether sweet old gent could actually be authentic survivor of heretofore 100-percent-lethal , H. sapiens-targeting , airborne bioweapon 's ferocity before he dropped other shoe : " You see , one of the problems of growing up the overly-protected son of a **34;1251;TOOLONG industrialist is that one can miss out on key life lessons . For instance , I now know that , no matter how hungry you get , you should never eat unrefrigerated mayonnaise .... " Plucky Girl Adventurer only partially successful in restraining unmannerly sputter of laughter at relief that flooded soul at explanation . Teacher had experienced similar affliction during attack ( though certainly not from mayonnaise ) . Beloved pedagogue had been under impression at the time ( had never been tested ) was H. sapiens himself ; convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History 's Compost Heap . But symptoms had proved to be result of botulism toxins . Not even we are immune to bad food . So pressed on : " Ever been sick otherwise ? Measles ? Chicken pox ? Mumps ? Flu ? Colds ? " Toymaker shook head at each question . " Now that you mention it , no , not that I can think of . Ever . " Brow furrowed ever deeper . " That does seem odd , does n't it . " " How did you do academically in school ? " Replied : Russian equivalent of straight A 's . " Did you compete in scholastic athletics ? " Had , and been darned good at it . " And have you found that your night vision is better than almost anyone else 's ? " By now Father Toys regarding me with undisguised amazement , not unmixed with alarm . " Who are you ... ? " he demanded finally . In response , told him who be was : Gave him rundown on heritage as H. post hominem . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing up by bringing up-to-date , to degree possible , regarding threat posed by remaining Khraniteli . Took news well . Better , in fact , than had myself . " Well , this explains some questions I 've wondered about most of my life-and even some I had n't thought of , " said Toymaker presently , shaking head slowly in wonderment . " Though it does n't , " he mused , eyeing me thoughtfully , " explain what a nice girl like you is doing in a place like this-clearly on course for that hellhole , Serdtsevina Rasovyi . " Spontaneous , right-out-of-blue mention of said hellhole caught Plucky Girl Adventurer flatfooted , Posterity . Forgot manners entirely . Without answering his question , demanded to know how he knew about Serdtsevina Rasovyi-never mind unsettlingly accurate characterization ! Father Toys regarded me for long moments before answering . " I have been to Serdtsevina Rasovyi , " he said slowly . " The miniaturized sensing , computing , and power-storage technology , and electric motor designs that we developed for our voice- and remote-controlled toys was fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ' invited , ' I thought by the central government , to attend a conference held there . I demonstrated some of our more advanced products for them . " Toymaker 's pause continued well beyond point at which could be considered pregnant before continuing . " They were so impressed that they requested data on our technology . In those days , when the government requested information , one provided it . " Expression darkened . " It is not beyond the realm of possibility that some of the technology I gave them that day contributed to the end of Mankind . " Sighed . Then glanced up with worried expression . " And if you please , again , what business do you have at Serdtsevina Rasavyi ? " Explained about Daddy . By conclusion , Father Toys ' expression was picture of distress . " You are so young ; you are so-please forgive my bluntness-tiny ! What can you hope to accomplish there all by yourself ? " Without going into specifics , replied had picked up specialized training , which ought to be helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During recital , Toymaker 's expression metamorphosed from distress to borderline horror to resignation to resolve . " Then perhaps this will be of assistance to you . I was escorted in and around most of that base . I have an excellent graphical memory ; I recall the base in detail . Would a map of the layout be helpful to you ? " Indeed ; base schematic had not been included in materials Wallace supplied . Working freehand , Toymaker quickly produced positively draftsman-quality sketch in black ballpoint on reverse side of nonpertinent aviation chart . " However , " he added darkly , " please understand , apart from the buildings into which I was invited , I have no knowledge of what any of the other facilities are used for . " Finally , with everything aboard Stallion but Foster twins , Father Toys cleared throat self-consciously . Glanced at him inquiringly . Russian 's expression clearly unhappy . " Would you like me to come with you on this quest to rescue your father ? " Oh , dear . If caught-with-pants-down situation had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toymaker deserved straight answer . So , in hopes would provide it himself , asked , " Have you been in the military ? " Had ; two years ' compulsory service twenty years ago . Qualified as marksman on range . " Have you had special-forces- or commando-type training ? " Uh , had not . " Have you ever killed anyone in cold blood ? " Toymaker blinked ; eyes went round . " No ! " Sighed . Or maybe shivered slightly . " I have . " Sudden , visibly horrified comprehension , sympathy appeared in sweet old Russian 's eyes as Special-Ops Girl continued relentlessly : " My plan is to sneak in , kill any sentries in the way , find Daddy , and get him out . Unless you have training or experience in that type of operation- " " I will undoubtedly just get you caught , " Father Toys finished thought sadly . Paused , eyed me reflectively ; then rueful smile flickered across features . " I think perhaps it is fortunate that we have become friends .... " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning Frisbee . Toymaker proved expert backhand-flip practitioner ; BC approved of technique . Approval lasted something over hour . Eventually though , time to leave . Russian hugged me as if own kin . Finally released , stepped back with brimming , worried eyes-which of course set off your Humble Historiographer as well : Amazing , how quickly bonds form in de- populated world .... Chelyabinsk , penultimate destination , selected after due deliberation . Respectable-sized city , though by no means huge . Charts , as well as between-the-lines interpolation of Danya/Wallace 's notes/off-the-cuff observations confirmed presence of well-equipped airport . Location , depth of resources fundamental to strategy : First , though Chelyabinsk barely 50 crow-flies miles from heart of Serdtsevina Rasovyi , Bad Guys ' big headquarters/shelter/lab beneath Urals ' spine , single entrance to which is drilled into side of valley some 15 miles east of Zlatoust , does lie beyond foothills , far enough back to minimize detection odds , either electronically or , via random malchance ( worse luck even than mis- ) , being observed by , stumbling into , some wandering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare plane for potentially protracted storage . Servicing needs to be thorough : Last stop prior to tiptoeing on foot into heart of enemy territory in all-out recon/infiltration mode . Intend to delay refueling until morrow ; depart directly from Chelyabinsk 's pumps with utterly brim-full tanks , following very-last-second refueling session . Sha n't leave even manual-recommended margin for fuel expansion due to heating by outside air-much warmer than nearly permafrosted soil under which tank farm resides . Stallion 's total fuel capacity , including Lennel 's custom-fabricated , extra fuselage tank , listed at 360 gallons . By morning , fuel remaining in ship 's tanks , following today 's final run , should be chilled nearly to temperature of that waiting underground . If heat differential between below-ground fuel stores , daytime air , provides expected nearly ten percent expansion , that amounts to close to 35 spontaneously generated additional gallons as fuel warms , expands . Expect turbine 's thirst to account for pretty much whatever excess may come into being from atmospheric warming during short hop from Chelyabinsk to Serdtsevina Rasovyi , which means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into engine , fuel level should n't drop at all . Of course , overflow vents will bleed off whatever engine does n't consume . Takeoff , final 50 miles ' treetop-level flight , plus landing , should take 15 minutes . Turbine consumes 50 gallons per hour , of which roughly 70 percent will be magically replaced during flight-clearly , if scheme works as advertised , will arrive at destination with tanks still brim-full ; i.e. , no trapped air . ( Mmm .. . Why does sophisticated , thermodynamics-based , fluid engineering plan sound so much like excerpt from brochure for perpetual-motion device ... ? ) Better work , however , regardless whether physics or Alternate Forces responsible . Otherwise , could find self returning to plane following multiple days ' -possibly weeks ' or even months ' -storage to find diurnally repetitious warming , cooling of trapped air has generated a gallon or five of H2O condensate , every drop needing to be drained prior to departure . Normally , accumulated water not problematical . Presence expected ; sump draining part of any normal preflight inspection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgency , perhaps with pursuing Khrantieli 's bullets parting hair , might forget to drain sumps altogether during abbreviated preflight inspection-i.e. , leap aboard , slam door , switch on ignition , push starter button , jam throttle forward , haul back on yoke , hold breath . Following which , assuming plane actually clears ground , almost certain to fall out of sky soon afterward as fundamentally noncombustible nature of water reaffirmed one more time . Physics has long attention span .... Chmaya to Chelyabinsk required long attention span as well . Too far to make in single hop , planned for touchdown at Surgut , on River Ob , for fuel , lunch , Frisbee . In terms of terrain , might as well have been flying over Midwest American heartland : flat to gently rolling terrain ; now forested , now grasslands , now moth-eaten , abandoned farmlands ; sprinkling of lakes , rivers . Mostly quite pretty landscape . Arguable , of course , that plentitudinous array of potential emergency landing options contributed to favorable opinion of vistas . Particularly since had no idea what sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rasovyi , even less desire to find out , so , as distance shrank , developed increasing aversion to height . Last two-thirds of flight consisted of progressive letdown from 1,000-foot cruising altitude . Final hour closing in on Chelyabinsk spent snaking along valley floors , arcing around hilltops , skimming under power lines , wheels virtually brushing forest roofs ( dodging between higher treetops ) during final 100 miles . Flight rivaled better air combat simulator video games ; furnished real-world epinephrine levels guaranteed to satisfy most demanding thrill junkie . Arrived well before dark . Got good start on stem-to-stern aircraft checkover before dusk began to intrude . We ate , then frisbeed . Gathering gloom appeared not to interfere with Maggie 's enjoyment of pursuit ; illumination sufficed for her simple purposes : Nailed Frisbee every time , even by the time I could hardly tell where it was . ( IR vision component useless for frisbeeing ; no temperature variation worth talking about . ) Border Collie 's motion tracker , however , apparently functions independently from visual-light spectrum . Or maybe BCs related distantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intensity , could be described as " batty . " ( Okay , sorry . ) Finally went to bed . Closed eyes , put arm over still happily panting , fuzzy baby sister snuggled against side-then found self wide awake , engrossed in detailed study of backs of eyelids , trying very hard not to brood about fact that only about 15 minutes ' flight remained before parking ship for last time , preferably someplace inconspicuous , covering with camouflage netting ( borrowed from AAs ' special forces ' stash ) , commencing shanks ' -mare area recon before - ( " Attention , attention ; this is not a drill . " ) -engaging enemy . Mmm ... Somehow , Posterity , this all seemed so much better idea during planning stages . Or , put differently , as Sven Nordstrom , Norwegian " political refugee , " slyly deadpan resident philosopher/fireman/EMT , back in pre-end-of-world Wausippi hometown days , was wont to observe in times of stress , " Hoooooh , jeeeez .... " Day IX Palomar to Alaska 's tip , 2,900 miles . Bering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across Asia . All in all , some 7,300 miles ' flying lay behind us as , two hours after sunrise , following aircraft prestorage maintenance wrap-up , and moments after final , **33;1287;TOOLONG , brimmest-full-possible fueling , we lifted off from Chelyabinsk , headed for Serdtsevina Rasovyi . Quarter hour later , eased through notch between tree-covered , rounded tops of relatively low , 40-mile-long , five-mile-wide , last-but-one , **36;1322;TOOLONG just north of Turgoyak . In interests of reduced visual conspicuousity , brushed uppermost leafy branch tips with main-gear tires as cleared summit . Pulled back throttle , floated downhill at near idle , propeller just ticking over , keeping eyes peeled for suitable landing site/hiding place for Stallion . Candidate emerged halfway down slope : Well before reaching broad , grassy valley floor , forest cover terminated in smooth , turf-covered hillside clearing , almost pastureland , whose uphill end disappeared into gloom under ancient oak grove , beneath whose sprawling limbs plane surely invisible from air , and pretty well hidden on ground as well , unless wandering indigene happens physically to stumble over it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place months ago during ultralight phase of aviation career . ( Oddly , bush-flying techniques not touched on during shuttle simulator training . ) But flying is flying ; Lennel agrees : Same set of physics governs Stallion 's aerodynamic behavior as person-rated toy airplane . No big deal . In theory . Lowered flaperons , leading edge Fowler slats popped out . Executed low , slow , gently banked 180 , maintaining barely enough altitude to keep from digging in wingtip . Rolled out of turn nicely lined up on clearing , whose lower end was still well above us on hillside . Added power , raised nose ; established gradually slowing climb calculated to intersect rising ground about a third of the way up-slope . Raised nose higher , slowed further despite adding more power . Increased backpressure on yoke , added still more power . Airspeed bled off as terrain rose faster than climb rate . Skimmed over final hedgerow bordering clearing 's lower end as rising ground finally intersected flight path . Wheels down/terrain up-distinction without difference . Chopped throttle , hauled yoke all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalled . No need for brakes , reversed thrust ; uphill rollout complete in less than hundred feet . Whereupon freshly graduated mountain pilot resumed breathing . Added power again ; S-turn taxied rest of the way uphill to , between trees ; parked beneath spreading branches of huge old oaks . Momentary blast of power gave rudder sufficient authority to aid one-wheel brake application in swinging tail around to face Stallion downhill . Set brake . Killed ignition . Sat back , sighed , feeling flight tension bleed from soul-only to be replaced by mounting preinfiltration apprehension ... Maggie stretched neck , nudged elbow with nose . Reached over , unlocked BC 's harness . Thought about pulling her onto lap for hug , but , as usual , hyperalert puppy had picked up cues ; already in motion . Held her for long moments as she leaned against me . Stroked , scritched ; thought Beautiful Thoughts-reflected on unlikely state of affairs : Substantial portions of two continents , plus symbolic spit of ( really cold ) ocean , now lay behind us ; Intrepid Girl Flying Ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way around world in furtherance of quest . Now all that separated us from Khraniteli stronghold ( and , **26;1360;TOOLONG ! ) was broad valley , big lake , plus single , modestly prepossessing mountain ridge .

" // " Are you sure ? " // " Positive . " // She was n't budging , so I went ahead and opened it . // Bad idea . // Instead of neat rows of chocolate nestled in gold foil , inside the box was a Ziploc bag of dried green leaves . // I slammed the lid down , hoping Sally was n't an amateur botanist . // Sally 's black-rimmed eyes grew huge . " Is that pot ? " // " What ? " I croaked . On second thought , maybe it would be better if she was an amateur botanist . Wolfsbane might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having it . // " The bag in there , " she said , pointing at the box . " It looks like weed . " // " Oh , it 's just peppermint , " I said , tossing off a light laugh that sounded like I was choking on a chicken bone . " Probably from my mother . " // Sally narrowed her little eyes at me . " Why would your mother send you peppermint ? " // " Peppermint tea , " I said . " She knows I like it . " Actually , it was n't a total lie . My mother did send me tea regularly , only it was n't peppermint . // I moved the box to my lap , resisting the urge to panic and trying to ignore the fact that Sally was still staring at me . A phone rang somewhere in the building . " Should n't you get the phone ? " I suggested . // " No , it 's Mindy 's again . " Sally wrinkled her nose . " That stuff does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner of yellow legal paper that was sticking out from under the lid . " Is that a note ? " // " You know , I 'm kind of busy this morning . " // " Are n't you going to read it ? " // Just then , a ring that was unmistakably Sally 's phone burbled from outside the door . // " Better go get that , " I said brightly . // Sally pursed her lips . " It can wait . " // I raised an eyebrow and tried to look official . " I do n't think Adele would be happy to hear that . " Adele was the head of the department and had an extremely low tolerance for anything short of professional . Which had always puzzled me , because it was Adele who had hired Sally . // Sally flashed me a nasty look and flounced from the office . When a few moments passed and she did n't reappear , I tugged the note out of the box and opened it . // Roses are red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are // And your boss soon will too . // Well , crap . // I stared at the note . Despite what Sally thought , the stuff in the box was n't pot . And it had a lot more punch than peppermint . Most people , in fact , would consider it poison . // But I was n't most people . // I was a werewolf. // And somebody else knew it . // I took another sniff , inhaling the familiar bitter scent . Since I 'm the daughter of a full-blooded werewolf and a psychic witch ( lucky me ) , I 've had to drink the stuff several times a day for years . Otherwise , I have a nasty tendency to transform every time something scares me. // Unfortunately , my mother did n't hit on the right recipe until I was almost ten , which meant a lot of my childhood was spent packing up my Barbie dolls ( I learned pretty early on that there was n't a Werewolf Barbie ) and sitting beside my mother in a U-Haul truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother raised me by herself , which meant I spent a lot of time in child care . // Which is hard enough if you 're a regular kid , but an absolute nightmare when you happen to be a bouncing baby werewolf . Full moons were a problem , of course-although these days , with the help of my mother 's brew , my involuntary changes were limited to four times a year-but what was worse was my propensity for sprouting teeth and fur every time something startled me or pissed me off . You can imagine what happened when I did n't get my bottle on time . // One of the more memorable episodes occurred in second grade , when a snotty little girl named Megan Soggs thought it would be fun to put a frog down my shirt at recess . I do n't know who was scared more , me by the frog or Megan by the wolf cub in penny loafers . But a week later , we were back in the U-Haul again , off to another city . // Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured out how to use wolfsbane tea to keep my issues under control without doing me mortal harm . So once we found a town that was werewolf free-which turned out to be Austin-my mother unpacked the U-Haul and bought a small house . Neither of us had moved since . I still drank gallons of wolfsbane tea , and it still did n't taste any better . As a kid , I 'd taken it with chocolate syrup , strawberry syrup , and large quantities of honey , but these days I just used Splenda. // I gave myself a quick shake and reminded myself that all of that was behind me now . Since Sally was still on the phone , I gave the box a quick sniff . Coffee , cigarettes , the faint aroma of a woman , overlaid with the deeper notes of male sweat . An animal smell too-cat , maybe ? I opened the Ziploc bag a crack . The wolfsbane was pure , probably grown in the Alps , if the woodsiness of the scent was any indication . // I fumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk drawer , behind the Tension Tamer herbal tea box that I stocked with my own special tea bags . Relax , Sophie , relax . I pulled up the waistband of my panty hose and forced myself to take a few deep cleansing breaths , like my friend Lindsey had taught me . After the third breath , I gave up-otherwise , I was going to hyperventilate . Besides , I did n't want to explain what I was doing pulling my control-top panty hose up to my boobs if Sally waltzed back into my office . Instead I leaned back and stared at the bottom left drawer of my desk . // The box meant that somebody knew I was a werewolf . And that was a big , big problem . // On the plus side-not that it was saying much-at least whoever it was did n't have all the facts . The New Age books all say that if someone like me gets within ten feet of the green stuff in the plastic bag , we wilt like pansies in August . Kind of a nonviolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // But unless I ate an entire bag of the stuff , wolfsbane could n't hurt me ; in fact , I drank it three times daily . Religiously . As in I set a timer and plan my days around it . Because if I miss even one dose , things can get . . . well , let 's just say . . . hairy . // I gave the drawer a moody kick , scuffing the toe of one of my new Prada pumps , and sank back in my leather chair . // A moment later , Sally walked back into the office on a fresh wave of musk . " Did you figure out what it was ? " // I shrugged . " Like I said , just a box of tea . From my mom . " // Sally narrowed her painted eyes at me . " Tea , huh ? " // " Yeah , " I said . It was n't too far from the truth ; since my mom did send me a box of special tea bags every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang . The call was from my mother 's shop . Which just goes to show that you should never think about a psychic-particularly one you do n't want to talk to . // After a pointed look from yours truly , Sally stalked out of my office . I could n't help noticing that her too-tight pants had given her a major wedgie . Surprising , really ; I would have pegged Sally as a thong girl . // I picked up the phone . " Sophie Garou. " // " Sophie ! " // It was n't my mother . Nor , unfortunately , was it Heath , whose deep chocolate voice was even more delicious than the truffles he surprised me with . Instead it was my mother 's assistant . I relaxed a little and gazed out the window at the Travis County courthouse , which was glowing in the morning sunlight as if everything in the world was hunky-dory and no nut job had left a nasty package on my nice clean desk . " Hi , Emily . What 's up ? " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . // I do n't like to admit it-particularly not to my clients , and definitely not to my boss-but my mother is the owner of Sit A Spell , a magic shop she opened fifteen years ago smack dab in the middle of Austin . // " What about her ?

My mother was many things-a fortune-teller , a spell-caster , and a medium , to name just a few-but she was n't a stellar bookkeeper .

@@4022411 Despite all rumors to the contrary , Sir Benedict Wayborn had not been born with a cast-iron poker lodged up his bum . He simply had excellent posture . Even while traveling alone , as he was now , in a hired carriage miles away from his own county , the baronet sat up straight , as stiff and unyielding in private as he was in public . His face might have been carved from marble as he considered his lack of progress in securing a wife . // He was on his way to Bath . A hard rain continued to fall as night closed in , but Benedict ordered the coachman to drive on . From Chippenham they advanced at a snail 's pace until , about four miles from Bath , they stopped altogether . A vehicle was foundering in the road , its wheels lodged a foot deep in mud . As servants worked to move it , a gentleman and a young lady watched from beneath a single umbrella . // Having lost half of his right arm as a boy after being mauled by a dog , Benedict was never eager for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite the Fitzwilliams to share his carriage for the rest of the journey . // Smelling strongly of cheap tobacco and French musk , the gentleman climbed into the carriage first . He scarcely looked old enough to be the uncle of the well-dressed young lady who jumped up after him , but that was his claim . Benedict kept his cynical suspicions to himself , and the carriage resumed its slow crawl toward Bath . The lady 's maid sat outside on the box with the driver , but the Fitzwilliams ' other servants were left to extract the gig from the mud . // Benedict had just begun to hope that his guests were as unsociable and taciturn as himself when the young man suddenly exclaimed , " Why , it 's Sir Benedict Wayborn ! Forgive my silence , sir . I did not know you were anyone . " // If the baronet forgave , he did so silently . // " I daresay you do n't remember me ; I 'm Roger Fitzwilliam . My brother Henry is married to the Duke of Auckland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely buckled to His Grace , you and I are brothers-in-law , are we not ? " Having established this tenuous connection , Mr. Fitzwilliam ventured headlong into intimacy . " How is the dear duchess ? Breeding , I trust ? " // " I have not heard from my sister since she left England on her wedding trip , " Benedict replied , fumbling for his black silk handkerchief . He sneezed into it violently . // " Must you wear so much scent , Uncle ? " hissed the young lady , embarrassed . // The Earl of Matlock 's daughter was a pretty girl of seventeen . Unfortunately , the purity of her skin was lost in the gloom , along with the brilliance of her dark eyes and the luster of her expertly curled chestnut hair . Her worst defect , however , was glaringly apparent : a wide space between her two front teeth . She looked as though she had not fared well in the boxing saloon . // " We waltzed together once at Almack 's , Sir Benedict , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose accused . " All my other partners called in person , except my Lord Redfylde , but he at least sent tulips-and he is a marquess ! " // Try as he might , Benedict could not remember dancing with her . She was just the sort of insipid , yet insufferably vain , debutante that had forced him to abandon London . // " Do n't annoy the gentleman , " Fitzwilliam admonished his niece . " As I was saying : what a good thing you were passing , Sir Benedict . We actually sank in the mud , by Jove ! I blame Rose : five enormous trunks full of frills and furbelows ! " // " It would be a very strange thing if I had fewer than five trunks , " Rose protested . " You men may wear the same thing three days running if it pleases you , but a lady must change her dress at least three times a day , and she must never be seen wearing the same thing twice . " // " Poor Rose ! Only seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive ? " // Rose did not choose to respond to her uncle 's impertinence . // " I daresay we will have less competition in Bath , " Fitzwilliam went on . " Eh , Sir Benedict ? Little Bath is not so crowded as mighty London . Cheaper , too , if that matters to you . " // Benedict merely eyed him with chilling scorn . // " I did not get on at all , " Fitzwilliam complained . " London ladies all think themselves too smart to be vicars ' wives , I can tell you ! If the Marquess of Redfylde would only make up his mind , we poor bachelors might get on , but , as it is , all the girls have set their caps at him . " // " We are not all mercenary , Uncle , " Rose said hotly . // Fitzwilliam 's smile was pained . " You must understand , Sir Benedict , that my niece 's season has been scrapped for a complete disaster . I am conducting her to her mama in disgrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bath , I daresay . The place is full of gouty old men on the lookout for something young and warm . Present company excluded , of course , Sir Benedict , " he added unctuously as Rose fought back sudden tears . // Fitzwilliam patted her hand . " There , there , pet . It was not your fault Westlands did not propose . You did everything you could . What did his lordship mean , taking her out driving in the park every day , waltzing with her at Almack 's , and then haring off to Derbyshire without proposing ? " he demanded , apparently of Benedict . " You know Westlands , of course , Sir Benedict : Lord Wayborn 's son . Why , you must be cousins . " // " The connection is very distant , I assure you , " Benedict said coolly . // " She might have had Redfylde himself , poor child , if Lord Westlands 's attentions had not been so marked . She might as well be used goods ! I 've a mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said maliciously , " You forget , Uncle , that Westlands is an excellent shot . " // " So am I an excellent shot ! " cried Fitzwilliam , and the pair fell to arguing over which gentleman would most likely be killed in the hypothetical duel : the viscount or the vicar . // Benedict took the opportunity to blow his nose . Perhaps it was selfish , but he did not care if Lady Rose Fitzwilliam died an old maid . He did not care if his distant cousin Lord Westlands had behaved like a cad . He did not care if Westlands and Fitzwilliam killed one another in a pointless duel . He wished he could set the Fitzwilliams down in the road and leave them to their fate , but , sadly , one was bound by a code of civility. // He pretended to fall asleep . Fitzwilliam soon slept in earnest , but Rose , bored , drummed on her jewel box with her gloved fingertips . " You can stop pretending now , Sir Benedict , " she said , pouncing onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some conversation , or I shall go mad ! " // He opened his eyes . " Kindly return to your seat , Lady Rose . " // " You 're only number fifty-six on my aunt 's list of eligible bachelors , " she sniffed angrily . " Aunt Maria says you 're too stuffy and dignified to run after girls half your age , but I 've noticed that you dye your hair black in an effort to appear younger . " // Benedict could not be goaded so easily . He simply closed his eyes again . To his relief , Rose returned to her seat and did not speak again until they reached her mother 's house in the Royal Crescent of Bath , and there she only thanked him haughtily as she quit his carriage . // Lord Matlock had not joined his countess in Bath . Therefore , his lordship 's youngest brother was obliged to put up in the York House Hotel in George Street . Fitzwilliam jumped out into the hotel yard , grumbling about the expense , and releasing such potent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the carriage until he stopped sneezing . Reluctant to return to the noisome , confined space , the baronet paid the coachman and dismissed him . // The house he had leased from Lord Skeldings stood at a distance from York House , but Benedict had strong legs and an excellent umbrella . For sixpence a boy from the hotel agreed to carry his valise . Declining both Fitzwilliam 's offer of a late supper , and the landlord 's offer of a sedan chair , he gave the boy the address , and they set off on foot . The rain , which had almost stopped , seemed to pick up again as they climbed up Lansdown Road to Camden Place . // By no means as famed as the Royal Crescent or the Circus , Camden Place was still one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Bath . Benedict had chosen it for its remoteness . The long , steep walk up Lansdown Road did not trouble him in the least . He liked to walk . // On a night like this , Benedict 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot brandy , but , oddly , there was no sign of Pickering as they walked up to No. 6 Camden Place . More puzzled than annoyed by his manservant 's absence , Benedict paid the boy from the hotel his sixpence and rang the bell . When no one answered , Benedict became concerned . // He could not possibly have guessed that the storm had played a cruel trick on him . This was not No. 6 at all . It was No. 9 . The violent storm had pulled the brass number loose at the top , spinning it around and around until it finally came to rest upside down . Pickering was waiting up for his master across the street . In fact , had it not been for the long , narrow park that ran down the middle of Camden Place , Pickering would have been able to see his master from where he stood looking out of the window , and Benedict would have been able to see him . // Benedict took out the key that his landlord , Lord Skeldings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his umbrella and wedge it between his knees first , which made it a wet and awkward operation . To make matters worse , a sudden gust of wind sheered his hat from his head and tossed it over the iron railings of the park . Benedict scarcely noticed the loss , having just discovered a greater calamity : his latchkey did not fit . // " Perfect ! " he muttered . Now he was annoyed . Cursing under his breath , he began to bang on the door with his umbrella . // Miss Cosy Vaughn gasped as her naked feet slapped the floor of her bedroom . The bare floorboards were so cold that , for a moment , she forgot why she was getting out of bed in the middle of the night . A rhythmic banging from downstairs soon restored her memory , however : some nameless fool was pounding on the front door , and if she did n't put a stop to it , the noise would wake up her mother , if it had n't already . Fumbling for the candle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth as she pulled on her dressing gown . // There was no fire in her room because the coal was running out , and the collier , who could roast in the hot coals of hell for all she cared , had declined to extend the Vaughns any more credit . Cosy had gone to bed bundled in a shawl , with woolly socks on her feet . The socks had itched so badly that she had peeled them off in the dark , but now , still half asleep , she searched for them , her teeth chattering . // The windows of her bedroom faced the street , but with the rain coming down in sheets , she could see nothing when she looked through the dark glass . As the knocking continued , she hurried to check on her mother and sister , who were sharing a bed in the next room to conserve fuel . Warmed by " logs " painstakingly crafted from tightly rolled overdue bills , the room was blazing hot . Lady Agatha , propped in a sitting position so as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snored peacefully while nine-year-old Allegra had flung the bedclothes off and was hanging half out of her mother 's bed , her mop of pale , straight hair almost grazing the floor . // " Who is he at all , Miss Cosy ?

" // Nora Murphy had come down from the attic with a shawl thrown over her nightgown , scraping her wiry , grizzled hair into a bun as she hurried down the hall . // " A bailiff would n't trouble himself in such weather , " Cosy shrewdly pointed out . " It must be a messenger , " she added , crossing herself in a quick prayer . // Nora 's beady eyes bulged in terror . " Is it our Dan ? " // Dan was Cosy 's brother . Lieutenant Dante Vaughn had recently sailed out of Tilbury on his way to join their father , Colonel Vaughn , who was stationed with his regiment in India . // Fearing everything from shipwreck to cannibals , Cosy ran back to her own room with Nora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Rain blurred her vision , but she could just make out the shape of a man . " He 's left-handed , " she reported , having absorbed in childhood the Irish superstition that left-handed people are an unlucky breed . // " A ciotog , " Nora cried , crossing herself . " Sure the left-handed are the Devil 's own . " // Ashamed that she had yielded even briefly to a silly old superstition , Cosy pushed her head out of the window again . " What is your message , sir ? " she called down , shouting over the roar of the streaming gutters . Her voice was instantly carried off by the wind , and she was obliged to scream at the top of her voice : " WHAT DO YOU WANT ? " // Benedict had rented a house complete with staff . " Let me in ! " he roared , incensed that one he took for a servant was not already downstairs waiting on him hand and foot . // " WHAT ? " Cosy shrieked , shielding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LET ME IN .

@@4022420 THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS PARACHUTE // A PHOTOGRAPH OPENS OLD WOUNDS // It 's not every day that a young man clad only in boxer shorts embossed with red hearts dies beneath an opened parachute in a small third-floor room in one of New York 's last boardinghouses . It 's even rarer that a visual artist , the owner of a Labrador retriever equipped with a generous belly , a fine mind and an admirable temperament , is called to the scene by the police department before the body is even cold . Yet this is exactly what happened just after ten p.m. on a recent mild March night . // I was sitting on my haunches in our cozy apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan , looking into the middle distance and allowing a mother lode of Chinese spareribs to settle pleasantly in my gullet . I felt a postdinner nap coming on and was not planning to resist ( in this hectic world it is often a struggle to get my twelve-hour sleep quota ) . Harry , my twenty-something owner , was beginning the third hour of a documentary on the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a narcoleptic whose voice rose at all the wrong moments , as if he had just been poked awake again in the sound booth . // Then the phone rang . My owner had already taken me for my evening Numbers 1 and 2 ( shortchanging himself van Gogh 's contentious roommateship with Gauguin at Arles ) and was loath to be roused from Grandfather Oswald 's La-Z-Boy for anything short of an evacuation of Manhattan for the apocalypse . He let the machine pick up , and Imogen 's voice filled our living room . // " Leave a message after the beep , " she said before trailing off into an uncertain whisper . " Harry , is it a beep ? " // The mild but decisive voice of the caller came next . // " Harry , it 's Detective Davis . If you 're there , pick up . It 's important . It involves . . . her . " // Harry flew out of his La-Z-Boy recliner and grabbed the phone . My nose could detect the strong waves of hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Detective Peter Davis , the lead investigator in Imogen 's case , had a breakthrough to report . Our lovely Imogen , who had rescued me from the pet-store clods and then included Harry in our domestic arrangements , had disappeared over a year before without a word or lead-foul play suspected . I had not yet informed Harry , but I had spotted her once again disappearing into a subway tunnel after the successful-if brutal-conclusion to our last mystery . That investigation had pushed both Harry and me to great extremes of endurance and ingenuity , and the end found us on the verge of an even larger mystery , which promised to span the globe in a conspiratorial and high-stakes web before it brought some resolution to our loss of Imogen . Detective Davis 's phone call was the beginning of what would prove to be Act II . // " I 'm here , " Harry said into the receiver , then listened without a word . He found a pen amid a pile of paintbrushes on the side table and scribbled down an address . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twenty minutes . " // My owner hung up the phone , grabbed a light jacket and disappeared through the door and down the stairs without a word to his dog . The peace was shattered-what is peace if it can be broken so easily ? -and all prospects of an after-dinner nap seemed to vanish in the face of this fresh anxiety . But fortunately I am built to endure , and soon the soporific magic of the spareribs began to affect me and I closed my eyes for a dreamless snooze. // Let me now share with you the particular facts that mark my existence . I am a Labrador retriever who lives in Manhattan , the isle of my birth , to which I am deeply attached . I am also sentient . Other dogs might be as well , to a greater or lesser degree , but few take pleasure from reading the important works of your human literature or make expansive journeys of imagination as Yours Truly does . I am self-taught , having learned to read from the pages of New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers , particularly those responsible for headlines , are the unheralded poets of our age ( by way of evidence , the Post ' s sublime : HEADLESS BODY FOUND IN TOPLESS BAR ) . Lest I lose myself in the sometimes lurid virtues of the tabloid , the main challenge of this Labrador 's life is the fact that his prodigious brain-2.3 pounds of smoothly functioning gelatinous gray matter-is trapped within a body as unresponsive to the nuances of thought as a piece of chocolate ( a delicacy I am supposed to avoid because my liver can not handle it ) . Because of this physical " frozenness , " I can not express in any facial gesture what I am thinking . Blankness is my trademark , though many humans describe my eyes as " soulful . " My tail has a life of its own and wags idiotically even when I am in a black mood . Then there is an involuntary body tremble that my owner frequently mistakes for bladder-based urgency because it jingles the tags on my collar ( not that I am ever ungrateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks of New York ) . Owners , please never underestimate the importance of liberal access to Numbers 1 and 2-no need to make us test our house-trained credentials . // Being unable to choose when I can relieve myself and under what conditions is symbolic of the many restrictions in my life . I can not , for example , simply walk out the front door of our apartment and wander the streets without a human chaperone . For most of my relatively short life ( I will be six in November ) I have not minded these restrictions . I have had wonderful people to whom I belonged and who belonged to me . I have had my books and a cozy corner in which to discreetly enjoy them , to listen to the wind or the rain on the drainpipe and mull over the wisdom of the classics and the music of words . // But then Imogen disappeared and people died and I needed to apply whatever strengths I had to protecting my owner and learning the truth . Prior to this development I had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm as my relations are with Harry , I never trusted the species as a whole . There is always some P. T. Barnum in the woodwork , ready to try to make a buck from the latest animal freak , or , worse still , an overly zealous scientist eager to shave off every inch of a Labrador 's fur and snap on the electrodes to prove that we are a higher form of life . No thank you . But despite my reluctance to " shine , " the necessities of protecting my owner and solving a mystery required that I construct a bridge between species . I did this by using Harry 's favorite cereal , Alpha-Bits , and composing messages from " beyond " out of the friendly little letters . Harry is susceptible to the idea of the paranormal . Ghosts , spirits , communication from beyond now make up part of his worldview . Someday , I hope , this irrational fever will pass , but we all nurse our wounds differently and losing Imogen was a harsh blow . For my part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog sense that have helped me navigate this life . Perhaps I stick to these things a little too much . The point , though , is that I used Harry 's susceptibility as a way to introduce the messages I wrote and make them credible . The messages came from a spirit guide whom I dubbed Holmes . My uncritical owner left the stone unturned and I was never found out , even though near the end I had Holmes indicate that I had been " inspired " and that my owner should follow my lead . // Harry returned to our apartment after three hours , and I awoke from my after-dinner slumber to find him smoking one of his emergency cigarettes as he came through the door . Things were clearly very grim . // Fortunately , my owner often gives voice to his recent experiences and thus keeps his dog well informed . The following is a narrative of what transpired after Harry left our apartment , which I have pieced together from his reiteration of events and information I gathered soon after . // My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detective Davis . He stepped out of the cab to find himself standing before a large red-brick residential building in the East Village . Most of the windows were dark , but one room on the third floor was ablaze with light , and Harry saw figures appear and disappear in the window : a man with a tape measure ; someone else in a big white suit with a face mask . It was a forensics team collecting evidence . // " No one in . No one out , " a police officer said . He stood between Harry and the entrance to the building . // " Detective Davis told me to come , " Harry said . // The policeman stepped aside . Harry climbed a short flight of stairs and , entering through the open front door , found himself in the lobby of what could have been mistaken for a New England bed-and-breakfast if it were not filled with an oddly incongruous bunch of foreign nationals , drag queens and vagrants . // " Wow , " Harry muttered as he absorbed the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even my owner knows that doilies , woven wicker baskets , plastic cornucopias with waxy grapes do not typically belong in the East Village and definitely not with this pirate crew . // " They 're the residents , " Detective Davis said from the landing of the interior staircase . He spoke loudly , as if he wanted everyone to hear . " Come on upstairs , Harry . " // Harry did as he was told and began to climb the several flights of stairs to the third floor . // " Interesting place , " Harry said . " What is it ? " // " A boardinghouse , " Detective Davis said . " Probably one of the last ones in Manhattan . There used to be hundreds , thousands even . Then they turned most of them into **30;277;TOOLONG buildings-but not this one . This one is classic Bowery bum . " // " Yeah , the people do n't really seem to fit , " Harry said as they climbed the stairs , occasionally brushing past crime-scene personnel carrying clear plastic bags filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . " I mean , there 's a complimentary coffee and tea station . There 's a fire going in the fireplace . There 're Currier and Ives prints on the wall . " // " Some of those are n't prints , " Detective Davis said in hushed tones . " Let me give you the short version . Ten years ago this place was a dump . A gun cage around reception . Dealers on the stoop . Graffiti all over that wall where the Currier and Ives are now . Then two things happened : the neighborhood started to improve , and the lady who owns the place won the lottery . Instead of doing what most people would with the winnings-buy a villa in Tuscany , sail the world-she decided to renovate the place . " // " I got it , " Harry concluded . " But she could n't get rid of the old tenants . That explains the people downstairs . " // " No , " Detective Davis said as they arrived at the third floor . " She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give them a taste of the good life too . Harry , I think that she is either one of the craziest women on the planet or the happiest . Most of the time I lean toward thinking she 's the happiest . After all , only the happiest sort of person would win all of that money and not leave their past behind . Only the happiest sort of person has that kind of peace . " // He paused . // " Now let 's go look at the corpse . " // Detective Davis motioned for the forensics team to clear the room , and two men and one woman in sanitary jumpsuits promptly exited with more bags of evidence . Harry moved as if to cover his nose the way he had seen in detective shows , but Davis intervened . // " No need . There 's no smell . If he 's been dead more than two hours I 'd be surprised . Forensics will tell us soon enough . " // Harry stood just inside the room and looked around . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , a writing desk and desk lamp , a waist-high chest of drawers and two large klieg lights brought by the police to illuminate the room . Then Harry saw the legs sticking out between the bed and the window . The legs ended in the white boxer shorts embossed with red hearts . The rest of the body was covered by a gently inflated white parachute that draped from the bed onto the floor like the roof of a child 's tent playhouse . // " You have n't moved it yet ? " Harry asked . // " Oh , yeah . We moved it , but I had them put it back . " // " For me ? " Harry asked . // " For me , " Detective Davis said . " I like to freeze the scene in my mind . It helps me trace backward if I know how it all finally ended . " // " Sounds like a meditation . " // " Only when the bodies do n't stink or someone 's not shooting a gun at you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harry observed . // " The parachute 's a real winner . The touch of the poet , " Detective Davis said . " He did n't die falling off his bed . He was strangled with the parachute cord . He 's a strong young man . Very fit . But there is n't a sign of a struggle . People do n't let themselves get strangled . They kick . They punch . They scratch . They fight . The only time they do n't is when they are n't conscious to begin with . Whoever did this first made sure he was n't conscious . He was probably drugged . I 'd guess chloral hydrate . We found two champagne glasses and a bottle-Schramsberg-the California bubbly Richard Nixon used to toast dtente with China in the seventies . It 's all being tested now , but I can already tell you what they 'll find . Powerful sleeping agent in only one of the glasses and plenty of DNA over everything . . . " // " I do n't get it , Peter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Detective Davis motioned toward the dresser , which was bare except for a large photo frame . // " Take a look at those pictures . " // The frame contained two photographs , one above the other . Both featured our mistress . The top photograph showed Imogen in a red cocktail dress , smiling broadly . The bottom photograph showed my mistress and Yours Truly , but I will save further description of the picture because it was the top photograph that gripped my owner now . In it , Imogen 's arm was around the shoulder of a young man . Her hair was short , as it had been when I had last seen her racing toward the subway. // " My God . It 's her , " Harry whispered . Harry reached to pick up the frame and hold it close , but Detective Davis stopped him . // " Harry , please do n't touch . It 's evidence . " // " Who 's that guy ? " // " That guy is that guy , " Detective Davis said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could n't tell you . I was hoping that you could tell me. " // " I 've never seen him before , " Harry said . " But Imogen looks so different . " // " Short hair , " Detective Davis said . " Is that it ? " // " I 've never seen the dress , " Harry said . " It 's very un-Imogen . She was a jeans and T-shirt girl . " // " So you think the photograph is recent ? " // " Excuse me ? " // " That it was taken after she disappeared . . . " // " What ? " // Harry could not grasp the meaning of Detective Davis 's words , because , as I mentioned above , I had not yet informed him that Imogen was alive . There was no " after she disappeared " for Harry . In Harry 's mind , Imogen had no " after " life that did not include him . Harry was of two minds : Imogen was dead , but , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She haunted him but was permanently frozen as the girl who had disappeared one winter 's night going to buy bread at Zabar 's . I should have conveyed what I knew to Harry , but , instead , I had decided to approach the revelation of her being alive in my own fashion , which meant after much careful and literary reflection . Dante , my Florentine poet guide , promised no help in this area , since Pinsky 's excellent translation was still buried beneath the daybed in our living room , where Harry had kicked it by accident on his way from bedroom to bathroom one drowsy morning . I turned to Proust and his prodigious work on memory but , alas , was asleep before the first madeleine . So I crossed the Channel to the land of Dickens . Dickens mixes his poetry with practicality , and his novels , of course , are stock full of people disappearing and popping up again . I began to work my way through Great Expectations in a small-print , nose-unfriendly paperback edition , and as Pip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page and began to play-not very nicely , those last two-in my imagination , I realized , once again , something that I have always known but frequently forget : literature is not a way to get practical things done . Nor should it be . It is a destination and occasionally an escape . When we return to this so-called real world from the book , it is like stepping back into time at the exact moment we had left . We may feel different , but nothing else has changed . And if we are different , we are different in ways that might be rich , wide and soulful , but not really practical . Go into a great novel or poem looking for the answer to A and you 'll get the answer to Z. It will be a good answer . But it will still be the answer to Z , not A. // Continues ...

Give me the egg and you will live . " // Still no response from the boy . For someone so young , this one had nerves of steel . Unless ... Was it possible ? Had Kiril been lied to ? There was something very wrong- // Faster than humanly possible , Huet swung around . Kiril had been prepared , and yet he still could n't match the boy 's speed . The youth shoved Kiril 's dagger aside , spun past his campfire and grabbed a large and obviously ancient sword . Kiril barely had time to draw his own sword before his foe was upon him . Extraordinary speed . Lightning-fast reflexes . And d ' -greth , power in his stroke . Huet had a killing strike with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest of Kiril 's problems . // " It 's not an egg anymore , is it ? " he asked , already knowing the answer . Dag Racho had sworn the demon spawn would n't hatch for another week at least . " Where is it , boy ? " he demanded . // Huet would n't answer . He could n't : He was dragonborn now . Huet-or Dag Huet now that he was joined mind to mind with his serpent beast-was losing his humanity by the second . His thoughts were completely consumed by dragon hunger , dragon power , dragon evil . There would be no sparing him now . // Assuming Kiril survived the battle . He swung his blade , parrying for all he was worth . The boy was in the prime of his physical abilities ; Kiril was old .

Dragons were agile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wings flap , felt the breeze on his back . Kiril wanted to turn and face the real threat , but Dag Huet attacked with renewed ferocity . // The boy 's blade had the speed of the wind .

It gave Kiril time to find an opening , some way to- // Too late . Dragon claws bit hard into his back , cutting through his leather and wire loga as if it were butter . The beast tried to pick Kiril up , but fortunately was too small to manage a man 's weight . Dag Huet had the opportunity to slice off Kiril 's head , but the boy was too new to being dragonborn to function as both man and dragon . He could be a dragon or he could be a man . Right now , it was the dragon 's turn . // Kiril twisted , sliced his dagger across the dragon claws that held him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the spurt of black blood , and the wyrm 's scream echoed through the small lakeside clearing . The claws straightened reflexively and Kiril was released-but not before he was thrown high into the air , across a jut of the lake . // At least he 'd landed far away from his foe , he thought , grimacing . Bloody claw , what was he going to do now ? He was paralyzed. // He looked up at the tree above him and realized with a distracted kind of fatalism that he was about to die . Here he was , Kiril , famous dragon-killer , lying like a discarded doll against a tree , numb from the neck down . Well , perhaps not totally numb . His hands had started to tingle and his legs were beginning to burn with pain . // Glancing around , he wondered how much time he had left to categorize body parts before he died . Dag Huet was the lesser threat . The boy had begun the long trek around the lake . Not even bothering to jog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember how to walk . It would take him a while to get here . // The Sapphire dragon , on the other hand , was an immediate problem . It lived only to kill . Well , to kill and amass a fortune whatever the cost-but mostly to kill . That now its essence had a human component mattered only because it made the beast harder to destroy . Both dragon and Huet had to die at once . // A hoarse cry split the air , guttural and terrifying . From Kiril 's crumpled position it was impossible to tell if the sound came from dragon or man , but it gave him hope nevertheless . The cry of a mature dragon settled deep into a man 's bones , stealing the strength from limbs and reason from even the most seasoned of warriors . A dragon in its prime was impossible to kill ; a man was defeated by sound long before the beast drew near . // But this cry had been loud and grating at best . This dragon was still immature . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could defeat it . At least , he had a chance if he could move . // The tingling in his fingers abated . Sensation returned slowly to his weakened limbs , and Kiril grunted as he struggled to stand . His knees quivered with pain , and his arm could not sustain the weight of his sword . The best he could do was lean over , gasping for breath as he braced himself in the cracked trunk of an aged tree . // Where was the dragon ? // Shifting his gaze upward , Kiril swallowed , seeing the answer suddenly appear . What at one moment had been a tiny speck far distant , suddenly became an explosion of blue falling from the sky . The Sapphire was diving . Straight at him . // Kiril tried to straighten , but the shift in his weight caused a lancing pain in his knee . He staggered , gasping in agony , but a crazy grin split his face . Thank the Great Warrior Tiril the beast was still young . If the beast were a week older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked to toasty perfection in a delightful meal for man and beast . But the dragon was too young to have developed fire in his lungs , and so the wyrm would have to capture his prize and eat it raw . // Raw and still fully conscious . // Kiril gritted his teeth , trying to force his thoughts away from his imminent demise . He knew mindlock was the dragon 's most potent weapon . But he was a trained fighter , a seasoned dragon-killer . He should be able to think . The dragon was still young . // And yet Kiril stood , waiting for his own death . // He had to move . // Move ! // He closed his eyes , forcibly blocking out the terror . Then , with deliberate thought , he flexed his muscles , calling for them to contract , to shift , to move . // Tense hip . Lift leg . // Contract thigh . Extend leg . // Shift weight ... land in pathetic heap . // That last had not been part of the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been amused , because at the moment of Kiril 's inglorious collapse the dragon 's claws passed mere inches above him . Kiril felt the heated rush of air , gazed upward in horror at the serpent 's glistening underbelly , then cried out in alarm as the tree above him splintered and cracked from the dragon 's impact . // Stupid dragon . It had missed him and got the tree . A thick branch caught the beast square on the shoulder at the base of its right wing . Stunned from the impact , off balance and flailing , the dragon tumbled backward with a startled croak and crashed into the lake . // If he 'd had breath to laugh , Kiril would have done so . Instead , he stared into the shimmering blue gaze of the Sapphire dragon and felt the mindlock seep into his bones . His mind slipped away ... // Splat ! // Icy lake water caught him full in the face . The dragon 's struggles were drenching everything , Kiril included . He jerked , reflexively turning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dragon 's gaze . He looked down at himself . Drenched from head to foot , he had to decide on his next move . He struggled up and fled behind the tree . // His next thought was to learn what exactly the dragon was doing , but that was the surest way to lose control once again . Instead , he closed his eyes and listened , sorting out movement and proximity as best he could . The beast was in the water , the wet slapping sound no doubt its wings beating heavy and sodden against the lake . A seasoned human controller would have sent his dragon rushing to the shore , directing its muscle movements with clear deliberate thought . But Dag Huet was too young to do this effectively-or perhaps even to see his wyrm 's danger . And that gave Kiril the time to act . // Pulling himself upright , he hefted his sword to use like an ax . He cringed at the abuse of the weapon-it was a family heirloom , the only memento he had left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so the exquisite blade became a tool to hack down a tree . // Fortunately , the parts of the tree not broken by the dragon had been softened by age and disease . Though thick and ancient , the core was wormy and soft . If Kiril had not spent a year logging , he never would have known where and how to strike . But he had , and he did . // Even in his weakened condition , he finished the job in just a few quick strokes . Then he dropped his sword into the mud , thinking only that this plan had to work : He had to topple the tree or he was a dead man . // He still did not look directly at the dragon hatchling , but the flailing sounds had grown more distinct . Rather than the frenzied splashes of before , now he heard more purposeful movement . The beast had probably managed to work its legs underneath him ; it would be mere seconds before the beast managed an ungainly leap into the air and escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grunted as he pressed his weight into the ancient wood . The rough bark bit into his flesh , scraping his hands bloody , but he barely noticed except to note that his grip became slick . He pushed and heaved , and yet all his strength accomplished nothing . The tree would not budge . // Did he need to cut the trunk more ? Had he misjudged ? Where was his mistake ? Doubt assailed him as he scanned the ancient tree . No , he had done everything correctly . He was sure of it . This would work . It had to . // And his faith was rewarded . The tree began to fall . // But was it in time ? Just as the wood gave way , Kiril heard a sudden explosion of water-the hatchling thrusting upward from the lake . The sound was unmistakable , as was the deluge of lake water that once again doused Kiril , chilling him to the bone . // Then came a heavy thud , the crackle of snapping limbs combined with a startled cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd won when he heard the burble of sound as the Sapphire continued to cry underwater . Turning his head , Kiril finally risked viewing his handiwork . // Stretching across the water , half submerged , was the ancient tree , branches broken , leaves falling to cover the churning water . Somewhere beneath the quivering wood was the dragon , kicking and flailing beneath the massive tree 's weight . // Another sound rent the air . Less than twenty paces away , Dag Huet screamed in horror , clutching his head to block out the dragon 's terrified thoughts . Even the most seasoned dragonborn could not control a wyrm in full panic . Dag Huet did n't stand a chance . // In the lake , the dark water churned as the dragon heaved and flailed to no avail . The tree was too heavy , the mud too thick , and the water too much an encumbrance for the beast to survive . Beside the lake , Dag Huet mimicked his dragon 's death throes , twisting and contorting , his human mind totally overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look . His eyes fell on his abused family sword . With sluggish movements , he pulled at the hilt , dragging the weapon out of the mud . The cuts in his back burned through his mind as full sensation finally returned to his body . He simply closed his eyes and breathed through the pain , waiting until it faded to a dull scream . Fortunately , he had the time . It would take long minutes for the Sapphire to drown . Long minutes as the boy struggled to breathe for his beast , his childish mind twisted , his youthful body wracked with pain as the serpent died . // Too long . // Stumbling forward , Kiril crossed the mud until he knelt beside Dag Huet . Again he noticed the clear blue eyes , soft downy hair and freckles that had no doubt delighted a generation of girls . Kiril saw again how angelic the boy truly was , and he felt like a hideous monstrosity beside him . // If he could , he would have spared the boy . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the boy scarred mentally and physically , his capabilities no more than those of a toddler , but alive . But it was impossible . The mind connection could only be severed before the dragon hatched . Once the serpent crawled out of its egg and into the boy 's hands , Dag Huet 's fate had been sealed . This youth would die at the same instant as his dragon . And the reverse . // In the lake , the dragon 's movements were slowing , each churning wave a little less high . Soon it would cease struggling . // Kiril raised his sword , unable to stop himself from looking into the boy 's eyes one last time , and was shocked to see lucidity within . Beside him , the lake stilled as the dragon lost consciousness . // " Why ? " the boy asked . // Kiril blinked . Huet knew why . Everyone knew why . // The youth continued , " Dag Racho is evil . I could ... " He dragged breath into his lungs . " I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deny the accusation . Dag Racho was evil . But Kiril worked for him , and had since he was a boy of twelve . // " I would have made things different , " the boy whispered . // Kiril closed his eyes , then plunged his sword down . He knew without watching that he had accurately pierced the boy 's chest , deftly cleaving his heart in half . Then , eyes still tightly closed , Kiril listened for the end . It came as expected , the rattle surprisingly gentle . Dag Huet was dead . // Suddenly overcome with weariness , Kiril 's hands slid away from the pommel of his sword , which was stuck firmly into the ground . His eyes opened to scan the water , confirming that the only ripples came from the wind . // He looked back at the boy , feeling a physical pain as he scanned the angelic face . It hurt to take it in . It hurt to see the water and the blood and the muddy ground . It hurt , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy 's words , but he did anyway . // Dag Racho is evil . // Yes , Kiril 's mind answered . Dag Racho is evil . " But so were you , " he whispered . // He pushed to his feet , more than weary , but still determined to give the boy a decent burial . He could n't fault the child for hope , for the naive dream that the Emperor could be defeated . Perhaps their ruler could be killed , but not by committing the same sin that had created the monster in the first place . Nothing good ever came from joining one 's heart and mind to a demon . " All dragonborn are evil , " he said aloud , repeating the phrase over and over , just as he had at the age of nine when first dragged to Dag Racho 's court to pay for his uncle 's crimes . Then he fell silent , even those words cut off as he looked at the boy . // Pain welled up inside him again . How he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But to not act would have been far worse . So , with a grunt of effort , he took the boy 's sword , stabbed it into the ground and began to use it as a shovel . // It was many hours before he finished . He worked sluggishly , like a tired old man . He buried the boy . He could do nothing about the dragon , but he made signs warning passersby that the water had been fouled by dragon . And then , after it was all over , he left . There was still one last task for him to achieve . // One more . One more dragonborn to kill . One more child to murder . One more naive hope to dash . And then it would all be over . // If he 'd had the strength , he would have smiled . As it was , he could only groan . // ( Continues ... ) // 
@@4022425 The Learned Council had an official name for Empire City . // Technotopia. // Yeah , it was n't a real word , but that was kind of the point . The Council loved to reinvent things , improve them , make them new and snazzy . Of course Empire had a lot of unofficial nicknames as well . // Mutantburg . Robotville . The Big Gray Haze . The City That Never Functions . // But Technotopia was the official party line , along with the motto " Building Tomorrow 's Town . Today . " I guess it all depended on what you thought the future should look like . If you were looking for a bright and shiny metropolis where all of civilization 's problems had been solved through the wise and fortuitous applications of equal parts science , wisdom , and compassion , then I guess you 'd be out of luck . But if your ideal tomorrow was a sprawling , impersonal city with rampant pollution , unchecked mutation , and dangerous and unreliable weird science , then I guess you would be right at home . // Name 's Mack Megaton . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learned Council liked to phrase it . There were three classes of robot in Empire . You had your drones : low sophistication models geared toward mundane tasks . Then there were the autos : humanoid models designed for more complex work . Then you had your bots : autos and drones that qualified for citizenship . I had n't quite reached bot status yet , but so far my probation had been going smoothly , and I was only forty-six months , six days , four hours , and twenty-two minutes from crossing that objective . I occupied a more vague class between auto and citizen . I could n't vote , could n't hold public office , and if the Learned Council decided to issue a recall , there was n't much I could do about it . // I was barely two years old and weighed a compact seven hundred and sixteen pounds . That 's light when you 're seven feet tall and made entirely of metal . I could punch through concrete and bend steel . I could not , however , tie a bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptive , intuitive , evolutionary . I was n't programmed knowing how to drive a cab , and I got along just fine doing that . I was n't designed to play poker , and I was a decent card sharp , though it 's easier to bluff when you have a featureless faceplate . But my artificial intelligence could n't wrap its binary digits around the ins and outs of getting a bow tie on . My hands did n't help any . They were n't designed for delicate work , more like sledgehammers with fingers . But the Bluestar Cab Company insisted all its drivers wear bow ties . Real , honest-to-God bow ties . No clip-ons . That 's what got me involved in the mess . // A bot 's got bills to pay . Bill , really . I used to be juiced by a small atomic power core . That was gone now . The Learned Council removed it as part of the terms of my probation . But I still consumed a lot of electricity in a day , and it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to go around in this town . To get my fair share to keep up and running costs plenty . It was fortunate that I did n't have many other expenses or I 'd have never been able to support myself driving a cab . As it was , I usually had to operate at half-power . Used to feel sluggish doing that , but I 'd gotten adjusted to it . // So every morning at the end of my recharge cycle , I 'd get shined up and dressed for work and head out the door . And along the way , I 'd stop by my neighbor 's apartment and have Julie wrap that tie around my barely existent neck . She did n't mind . She was the nicest , warmest person I 'd met in Empire . Every time I scanned her , I was always glad I had n't gone with my original program and led that robot army . // She was always expecting me , usually already waiting with a smile and a friendly word . Today , she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kids were a handful sometimes . And her husband was n't much help . // I knocked on the door . No one answered . My internal chronometer counted off sixty seconds before I knocked again . It was another thirty-six seconds before the door slid open and Julie stuck her head out . By then my intuition simulator started beeping . When that little ping went off in my right audio sensor , it usually meant trouble . I could n't turn the damn thing off , so I did my best to ignore it . // " Mack . " She looked surprised to see me . " Oh , Mack , I 'm sorry . I forgot . " // She slid the door wide enough to step out and shut it before I could catch a view inside . She snatched the bow tie from my large metal hands and started to tie it . She fidgeted a bit , glanced back at her closed door . // " Everything all right , Jules ? " I asked , despite my better judgment . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it came out anxious . " Oh , everything 's fine , Mack . Thanks for asking . " // I was pretty good at reading people . I had a peachy little voice and body language analyzer subroutine that rarely failed , but I did n't need it for this because Julie was a bad liar . // I 'd done my part . I 'd asked . It was n't any of my business now . Probably nothing serious anyway . Stress is stress . The biological body reacts the same way no matter the source , whether being chased by a bear or in the middle of a domestic tiff . Julie and her husband fought a lot . // But Julie always smiled for me . Always . She was smiling now , but it was n't the same . My analyzer did n't bother spelling it out to me , but it encouraged that pinging in my audio to get louder . // " There you go , Mack . Sorry , it 's a little crooked , but I 'm kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jules . Thanks . " // " Sure . " Another furtive glance at that door . " Have a great day . " // I was about to return the sentiment but she disappeared into her apartment before I got the chance . // " Mind your own business , Mack , " I said . // Talking to myself was a bad habit . You 'd be surprised at the extraneous behaviors that make it into your personality template when you hang around with biologicals . My intuition must 've caught the hint though , because it stopped beeping. // I adjusted my tie , careful not to loosen it or else I 'd have to knock on the door again . I was n't built for stealth , and the strange yellowish metal they use for flooring in the cheaper apartment complexes squeaks when I walk on it . Despite the noise and my stalwart vow to keep my nose clean ( which should have been easy since I did n't have a nose ) , I heard something break in Julie 's apartment . A plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious . // I stopped , cranked my hearing to the max . My audio array is n't much better than human hearing , but I 've got a directional mic . It does n't penetrate steel doors . Everything in Empire , even the doors , was made of metal . // Muffled voices . Julie 's . Gavin , her husband . Holt , one of the kids . Somebody else I did n't know . Another round of shattering glass . And another . Then a stifled scream . The wet slap of meat hitting meat , somebody getting hit . Crying . // My intuition simulator did n't fire up again . No need for it . I did n't need a ping to tell me there was a problem . // Consciousness is a quagmire , whether found in squishy organic tissue or an interminable string of squirming electrons . I do n't know where logic is found in the human brain , and I do n't understand the inner workings of my own electronic brain either . It 's dozens upon dozens of programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical stuff . Somewhere in my common sense replicator , in that ricocheting string of ones and zeroes , there must 've been a digit missing , and as I moved back toward Julie 's apartment , I cursed Professor Megalith for not spending more time in beta testing . // I knocked . It got quiet inside real fast . The door slid open . Julie stuck out her head . // " Is everything all right , Jules ? " I asked again . // She answered the same way . " Yeah , yeah . It 's fine . " // " How 's Gavin ? " // " He 's fine . " // We did n't say anything for a bit ( four seconds for those of you without a built-in clock ) , but I could record crying still coming from inside . April , their daughter : one of the top voices in my recognition file . Hearing her sob quietly made me glad I was doing this . But what was I doing ? // " It 's not a problem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Empire was a progressive town . It 's the only city in the world where a robot could earn full citizenship rights . But I was built for world domination , and I could n't blame the authorities for wanting some time to see if I was truly interested in reforming . I had another four years probation left before the law considered me safe enough for citizenship consideration . If I blew it , there 'd be no place left for me to go where I would n't be just another piece of property , an unlicensed weapon with a mind of its own , headed for the scrap heap . // If I barged into that apartment , I 'd blow it , but if I was n't going to follow through , I should n't have come back in the first place . // Julie tried to slide the door shut , but I thrust my hand against the jamb . I did n't ask to come in . I pushed it open and stepped inside . // The apartment , like 92 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various areas . Except the bathroom , which was a metal box ( always metal ) in the corner about the size of three phone booths put together . It did n't take long to sweep the place with my opticals and see the problem . It was n't Gavin , as I 'd first assumed . He slouched in a chair . He held a hand clamped over his mouth , and blood dripped down his chin . I spotted broken dishes and the remains of half-eaten breakfast scattered on the floor along with two teeth . Gavin 's , I assumed . // The kids were huddled in a corner . They were both mutants . Few people were born mutated in Empire . It was more often something that just happened one day . There were a lot of strange chemicals in Empire 's waterworks , weird radiation pockets hovering in its streets , and unstable mutagenic gases floating invisibly in the air . On any given day , every biological citizen was subjected to dozens of genetic destabilizing agents , and every citizen knew that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . There did n't seem to be a pattern to it , and your social status , the size of your bank account , none of that mattered . // Of the two Bleaker kids , Holt was the more obvious mutant . He had scales and a long tail . Nothing too serious . Mutation was acceptable in Empire , even commonplace , and while the rest of the country was working out issues based on hereditary pigmentation , Empire had moved well past such noisy debates . It was just impractical to argue when the only real difference between a norm and a mutant was one unpredictable genetic reaction just waiting to happen . // April was psychic . She was only eight , so the exact nature of her talents was still a work in progress . She sometimes saw little snippets of the future , and she was telekinetic enough to push around a pencil . Like all psychics , her eyes changed color when she used her talents . A vibrant purple with clairvoyance and sky blue with telekinesis . Right now her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scanned the spider veins of red along her sclera . That 's the white of the eye . Do n't ask me why I was programmed with that data . Tears rolled down her cheek . // All this I scanned and absorbed in a sixteenth of a second . My hearing may not be great , and I do n't have any olfactory sensors , but my optical tech is second to none . It did n't only spot , analyze , and filter these little details , it also told me what the problem was . Not that I needed an analyzer to spot the four-armed guy with the bruised knuckles . // I 'd intervened in a domestic disturbance and found myself in the middle of something worse . An abusive spouse I could handle . Four Arms was obviously going to be more trouble . // " What the fuck are you ? " Four Arms smacked Gavin on the back of the head . " Who the fuck is this bot ? " // " He 's nobody , " replied Gavin through his sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah , " I agreed . " I 'm nobody , and you 're leaving . " // I took a step forward , but Julie grabbed me by the arm . " Please , Mack . Do n't . You 'll only make it worse . " // She was right . Whatever mess Gavin had gotten himself and his family into , I could n't fix it . Foolish to even try . // " Sorry . I should n't have interfered . " // " Damn right you should n't have . " Four Arms smacked Gavin again , just to remind me he could . My fingers tightened into metallic battering rams . I could punch a hole right through this guy , but it was n't the right thing to do . Not in the long run . // April ran across the room and wrapped her limbs around one of my legs . She looked up at me with those big eyes of hers . Big , shining purple eyes . Pleading , clairvoyant eyes . // " Do n't go , Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you do , something bad will happen . " // That was enough for me . I pulled her gently off my leg and set her behind me . " It 's okay , kid . I 'll take care of it . " // I turned on Four Arms , and he did n't wait for me to get closer before drawing a raygun and blasting me . The red beam burned a hole through my uniform , bounced off my metallic skin , and blew a small puncture in the refrigerator . Four Arms did n't learn his lesson and prepared to fire again . // I held up a hand . " Do n't . It wo n't hurt me , but if a ricochet hits anyone in this room other than you , you 'll have a bigger problem than you do right now . " I slammed my fists together with a reverberating clang to let him get the idea . // I could 've been on him in a second except I 'm a big bot and I 'd have smashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arms time to reach into his jacket and activate something . He disappeared in a flash , teleported away . He could n't be invisible . I had yet to meet a cloaking system that was a match for my opticals . The Big Brains had been working on teleportation for decades and had n't gotten it worked out yet . Of course , maybe Four Arms had beamed back to his hideout and arrived as a pile of mutilated gelatin . If so , maybe the problem was solved , and I had nothing to worry about . // " You should n't have done that , Mack , " said Julie . // I should n't have done a lot of things so far today , but I 'd done them . Since temporal relocator technology was still a pipe dream , I had to deal with them . // " What 's going on , Jules ? " I asked . // " None of your damn business ! " Gavin shouted , spitting blood on my uniform . " We did n't ask for your help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone and screwed it all up ! Now there 's going to be trouble ! " He stomped off to a corner of the apartment to mutter and swear . // I ignored him . He was always a mealy little worm . If I 'd thought Four Arms was there to blast Gavin , I 'd have let it happen . But I 'd made precious few friends since striking out on my own . I did n't want to lose the few I had . Robots do n't have family . Julie and the kids were the closest thing I 'd ever get . // " I can help , Jules , " I said . // " It 's our problem , Mack . You do n't need to get involved . You 've got your probation . " // " Let me worry about that . " // " No . " She grabbed me by the arm and pulled me toward the door . I did n't resist and let her lead me back into the hall . " I appreciate your concern , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // I was going to argue , but my self-preservation directive kicked in . I could n't make Julie take my help . I 'd tried . I could walk away now with a clear conscience . // " If you change you 're mind , Jules- " // She slid the door shut in my face . // I shrugged and headed back toward the escalator . I 'd catch hell for being late , and I 'd catch more hell for having a hole in my uniform . I 'd have to buy a new one , and they were n't cheap in my size and wide-shouldered proportions . // The door slid open , and April , clutching a piece of construction paper in her hand , ran over to me . " Mack , Mack ! I 've got something for you . " // I leaned down on one knee and put my hands on her shoulders . That little girl always reminded me how dangerous I was , how I could crush her without even 5 percent of my power on . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing in my universe . I 'm as sentimental as the next bot. // She handed me a drawing . It was crude , but not bad for an eight-year-old , especially since she only drew using her telekinesis . I recognized the chunky , red mechanical anthropoid as me , and next to me was a little smiling girl with a round face and purple eyes , stick figure limbs , and a red triangle for a dress . // " Thanks , kid . " // " You wo n't throw it away , will you ? " she asked . // " Are you kidding ? This goes right on my refrigerator . " It 'd be nice to finally have a use for the old rusted machine . Right now , all it did was occupy space in my unused kitchen cubicle . // The apartment door slid open . Gavin stepped into the hall . He still looked like hell , but he always did . Guy had gone straight past two-time loser to sixth or seventh by my estimation . // " April Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped her arms around me . " You better get to work , Mack . " Her eyes flashed purple . " Your boss is going to yell at you , but do n't worry . Just ignore him , and it 'll be fine . " // She ran back into the apartment without looking back . Gavin threw me a hard glare before following her inside . // I folded the drawing very delicately with overgrown metal fingers and tucked it in my pocket . It did n't even occur to me to scan the back . If I had , maybe what happened would n't have happened . But I did n't , and it did . // That 's the problem with having a hard memory matrix . Short of a system crash , you ca n't forget the mistakes you make . //
